doxycycline

Tetracycline and its derivatives have historically been used for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea and there is data to support their use. A modified-release doxycycline is FDA-approved for this indication. Amoxicillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole lack evidence to support their use in the treatment of papulopustular rosacea.
