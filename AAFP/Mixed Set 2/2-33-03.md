Spironolactone (Aldactone)

Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist. This class of drugs has been found to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiac death when initiated after a myocardial infarction in patients with a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and signs of heart failure. Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend the use of aldosterone blockers in patients who have heart failure or diabetes mellitus, have an LVEF :40%, are receiving ACE inhibitors and p-blockers, and have a serum potassium level <5.0 mEq/L (5.0 mmol/L) and a creatinine level >2.5 mg/dL in men or >2.0 mg/dL in women. None of the other medications listed has this level of evidence to support its use.
