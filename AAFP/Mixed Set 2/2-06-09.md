Splinting in full extension

This patient has a mallet fracture. These fractures are caused by an axial load to the tip of an extended finger that causes forced flexion at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. This leads to a fracture at the dorsal surface of the proximal distal phalanx where the terminal finger extensor mechanism inserts. The most appropriate treatment of a mallet fracture is to splint the DIP joint in extension for 8 weeks. The joint should remain in full extension for optimal healing. Any flexion of the finger may affect healing and extend the treatment time.

Surgical management has been recommended for fractures that involve more than 30% of the joint space, but a small study showed there was no difference in outcomes compared to treatment with extension splints. Buddy taping would not offer enough support to maintain the finger in extension at all times.
