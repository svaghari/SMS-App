A CBC, a C-reactive protein level, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate

Joint pain in the presence of fever with no apparent source indicates a possible infection, malignancy, or rheumatologic condition and requires further workup. Laboratory evaluation, including a CBC, a C-reactive protein level, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate can help assess for these conditions, even though none of the tests is sufficiently sensitive to rule out these diseases, and they are not specific to a single disease entity. Knee joint aspiration would be indicated to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of a joint effusion. If the hip were painful or had decreased range of motion, then ultrasonography could help identify a hip joint effusion, which would need to be aspirated. MRI may be needed in this patient, but it would likely require sedation and thus is more invasive. Starting with laboratory work is a good first step toward identifying the source of his pain and fever.
