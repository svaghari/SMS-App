Surgery

NSAIDs, pyridoxine, and diuretics have been shown to be no more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. Splinting, physical therapy, and corticosteroid injections have all been shown to result in short-term improvement. Patients with persistent symptoms achieve the best long-term relief with surgery.
