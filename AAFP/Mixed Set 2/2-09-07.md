Dyslipidemia

SBecause of concerns about the growing epidemic of obesity in this population, the
American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends screening for elevated serum cholesterol
levels in children 9–11 years of age (SOR C). This patient should also be screened annually
for depression beginning at 11 years of age and continuing through 21 years of age.
Universal screening for iron deficiency anemia is recommended at 12 months of age and
again at 15–30 months of age if the patient is determined to be high risk. HIV screening
is recommended in adolescents 16–18 years of age, and age 21 is now the recommended
starting age for screening for cervical dysplasia. Universal screening for diabetes mellitus
is not recommended for children or adolescents.
