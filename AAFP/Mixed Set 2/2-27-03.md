Minocycline (Minocin)

Oral antibiotics are effective for the treatment of moderate to severe acne (SOR A). Combined treatment with benzoyl peroxide is recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial resistance (SOR C). Amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin are not recommended for acne treatment. Intralesional corticosteroid therapies have been tried for acne treatment, but long-term use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended.
