Lower tidal volumes

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may be caused by pulmonary sepsis or sepsis from another source, or it may be due to acute pulmonary injury, including inhalation of smoke or other toxins. Inflammatory mediators are released in response to the pulmonary infection or injury. The syndrome has an acute onset and is manifested by rapidly developing profound hypoxia with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. The mortality rate in patients with ARDS may be as high as 55%.

Early recognition and prompt treatment with intubation and mechanical ventilation is necessary to improve chances for survival. Patients with ARDS should be started at lower tidal volumes (6 mL/kg) instead of the traditional volumes (10â€“15 mL/kg) (SOR A). These patients also often require higher positive end-expiratory pressure settings (SOR B).

Fluid management should be conservative to allow for optimal cardiorespiratory and renal function and to avoid fluid overload. However, the routine use of central venous or pulmonary artery pressure catheters is not recommended due to the potential complications associated with their use (SOR A). While surfactant is commonly used in children with ARDS, it does not improve mortality in adults (SOR A).
