Hyperglycemia

A decrease in serum sodium concentration does not always indicate a decrease in osmolality of body fluids. In cases of hyperglycemia, the main cause of the hyponatremia is the glucose-related increase in osmolality of extracellular fluid, followed by the movement of water from intracellular to extracellular fluid compartments and a subsequent loss of excessive extracellular fluid and electrolytes. The serum sodium concentration is also diminished in patients with hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinuria because of the volume occupied by the lipids or proteins. If the lipids or proteins are removed, the sodium concentration in the remaining plasma is found to be normal. No treatment is needed for these conditions.
