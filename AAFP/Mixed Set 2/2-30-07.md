Nasal suction to clear the upper airway

Recommendations for the treatment of hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis include nasal suctioning via
bulb or neosucker to clear the upper airway. Deep suction (beyond the nasopharynx) is not recommended.
Oxygen is recommended for infants with a persistent oxygen saturation <90%. Bronchodilators should
not be used routinely in the management of bronchiolitis, and corticosteroids, antibiotics, nasal
decongestants, and chest physiotherapy are not recommended. A single trial of inhaled epinephrine or
albuterol for respiratory distress may be considered, but only if there is a history of asthma, atopy, or
allergy.
