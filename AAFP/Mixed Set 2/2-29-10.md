Immune thrombocytopenic purpura

The rash described in this patient with significant thrombocytopenia is consistent with purpura. Purpura from vasculitic causes such as meningococcal infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (also known as IgA nephropathy) is typically palpable rather than macular as in this case. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is a relatively common cause of isolated thrombocytopenia. The lack of systemic symptoms or other abnormal laboratory findings make acute lymphoproliferative disorders such as leukemia unlikely. Likewise anemia, neurologic changes, fever, and renal failure are seen with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The acute onset of purpura and heavy periods makes congenital thrombocytopenia unlikely.
