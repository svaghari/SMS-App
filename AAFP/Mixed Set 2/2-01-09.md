Cefazolin

Cefazolin is appropriate for intrapartum prophylaxis against group B Streptococcus (GBS) in penicillin-allergic patients who do not have a history of anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, or respiratory distress. Depending on the antibiotic sensitivity of the GBS organism, either vancomycin or clindamycin is recommended for patients at higher risk for anaphylaxis.
