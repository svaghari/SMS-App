Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a documented drop in blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic that occurs within 3 minutes of standing. When symptomatic it is often described as lightheadedness or dizziness upon standing. Etiologies to consider include iatrogenic, neurologic, cardiac, and environmental causes, plus many others alone or in combination. Since orthostatic hypotension may result in syncope, leading to falls and substantial injury, identifying it and taking corrective steps can produce a significant benefit.
