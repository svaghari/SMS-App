Calcific tendinitis

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is effective for calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff. Side effects include bruising and pain. Needling and irrigation, physical therapy, and cortisone injections are sometimes used in patients with acute symptoms. Endoscopic and open surgical treatments are alternatives to extracorporeal shock wave therapy in refractory cases. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy does not have an established role in gout, rotator cuff tear, frozen shoulder, or hooked acromion.
