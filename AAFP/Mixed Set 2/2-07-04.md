Echocardiography

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease manifested by skeletal, ophthalmologic, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Men taller than 72 inches and women taller than 70 inches who have two or more manifestations of Marfan syndrome should be screened by echocardiography for associated cardiac abnormalities. These signs and symptoms include cardiac murmurs or clicks, kyphoscoliosis, anterior thoracic deformity, arm span greater than height, upper to lower body ratio more than 1 standard deviation below the mean, myopia, and an ectopic lens.

Athletes with a family history of Marfan syndrome should also be screened, whether they have manifestations themselves or not. Patients with Marfan syndrome who have echocardiographic evidence of aortic abnormalities should be placed on Î²-blockers and monitored with echocardiography every 6 months.
