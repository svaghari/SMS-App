Saline

The initial management of hypercalcemic crisis involves volume repletion and hydration. The combination of inadequate fluid intake and the inability of hypercalcemic patients to conserve free water can lead to calcium levels >14–15 mg/dL. Because patients often have a fluid deficiency of 4–5 liters, delivering 1000 mL of normal saline during the first hour, followed by 250–300 mL/hour, may decrease the hypercalcemia to less than critical levels (<13 mg/dL). If the clinical status is not satisfactory after hydration alone, then renal excretion of calcium can be enhanced by saline diuresis using furosemide.

Intravenous pamidronate, a bisphosphonate, reduces the hypercalcemia of malignancy and is best used in the semi-acute setting, since calcium levels do not start to fall for 24 hours. Glucocorticoids are useful in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with certain malignancies (multiple myeloma, leukemia, several lymphomas, and breast cancer) or with vitamin D intoxication. The onset of action, however, takes several days, with the effect lasting days to weeks.
