The presence of generalized peritonitis

Acute diverticulitis can be treated using oral antibiotics on an outpatient basis in 90% of cases. In fact, there is good evidence that those with uncomplicated diverticulitis (no signs of abscess, fistula, phlegmon, obstruction, bleeding, or perforation) can be treated without the use of antibiotics, using only bowel rest and close follow-up. Among patients who require hospitalization, it is estimated that <10% of cases will require surgical intervention. Thus, the majority of patients hospitalized with this condition, even those with complicated diverticulitis, will respond well to bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics.

Indications for surgery include generalized peritonitis, unconfined perforation, uncontrolled sepsis, an undrainable abscess, and failure of conservative management. CT-guided percutaneous drainage of an accessible abscess is a well-proven treatment to avoid the use of open surgery. Prevention of future episodes of diverticulitis increasingly revolves around the use of daily oral medications. Some experts recommend considering surgery to remove a section of bowel after a patientâ€™s third admission for diverticulitis.
