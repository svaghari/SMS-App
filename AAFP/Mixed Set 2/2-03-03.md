A lace-up ankle support

A lace-up ankle support reduces pain and recovery time after an ankle sprain (SOR B). The Ottawa Rules state that radiography is required only if there is pain in the malleolar or midfoot zone and either bony tenderness over an area of potential fracture (i.e., distal fibula or tibia, lateral or medial malleolus, base of the fifth metatarsal, or navicular bone) or an inability to bear weight immediately after the injury and when evaluated by a physician. This patient did not have those findings, and therefore would not need a radiograph (SOR A). A cast is not necessary for an ankle sprain. An elastic compression wrap alone is not as effective as a lace-up support. Taping of the ankle for future sports participation can reduce the risk of ankle sprains during sports, but would not be appropriate for an acute injury.
