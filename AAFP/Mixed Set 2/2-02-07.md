Loss of interest or pleasure in all activities

While there is significant overlap in the symptoms of each condition, there are some signs and symptoms that help the family physician determine whether a terminally ill patient is experiencing grief or has major depression. This distinction is important because the terminally ill patient with depression would likely benefit from antidepressant medication, whereas a patient with end-of-life grief is generally best managed without psychotherapeutic medications.

The key clinical feature in distinguishing the two conditions is in the pervasiveness of symptoms in depression, particularly the loss of pleasure or interest in all activities. Episodic feelings of guilt, anxiety, and helplessness, and even thoughts of wanting to die can and do occur with grief reactions, but these feelings are not constant and over time the symptoms gradually wane. Terminally ill patients with major depression feel helplessly hopeless all the time, but they often respond to and significantly benefit from antidepressant medication (SOR A).
