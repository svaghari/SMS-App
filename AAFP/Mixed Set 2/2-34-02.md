The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (Mirena IUD)

This patient has heavy menstrual bleeding, associated anemia, and morbid obesity, all of which need to be taken into consideration when choosing contraception. Medroxyprogesterone acetate can contribute to weight gain and thus should not be the first choice in this individual. The norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system is not recommended in patients with a weight over 90 kg and thus is not an option for this patient. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system would be the best option, given the associated significant decrease in menstrual blood loss after the first 3 months of insertion and equal effectiveness in obese and non-obese patients. Although a diaphragm is an option, it will not decrease her menstrual blood loss.
