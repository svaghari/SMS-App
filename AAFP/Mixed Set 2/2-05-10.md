Deliver more efficient, high-quality services by encouraging cooperation between health care providers

The concept of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) was introduced in 2009 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to encourage doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers to work together to deliver high-quality care and spend health care dollars more wisely. The ACO concept, together with a shared savings program, has had difficulty penetrating smaller practices and more rural regions of the country. There is also concern that ACOs may allow larger systems to work as a monopoly as an unintended consequence. For this reason the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are monitoring these organizations as they develop.

This new strategy of shared savings through coordinated health care is an alternative to the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula that CMS had previously hoped would contain health-care costs. The SGR was created to prevent Medicare rates from growing faster than the GDP. The high-profile topic of requiring individuals to carry health insurance has also been part of governmental reform initiatives but is not directly related to ACOs.
