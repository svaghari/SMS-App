Impaired autoregulation of glomerular blood flow

Blood flow to the kidney is autoregulated so as to sustain pressure within the glomerulus. This is influenced by angiotensin II–related vasoconstriction. ACE inhibitors can impair the kidney’s autoregulatory function, resulting in a decreased glomerular filtration rate and possibly acute renal injury. This is usually reversible if it is recognized and the offending agent stopped. NSAIDs can exert a similar effect, but they can also cause glomerulonephritis and interstitial nephritis. Statins, haloperidol, and drugs of abuse (cocaine, heroin) can cause rhabdomyolysis with the release of myoglobin, which causes acute renal injury. Thrombotic microangiopathy is a rare mechanism of injury to the kidney, and may be caused by clopidogrel, quinine, or certain chemotherapeutic agents.
