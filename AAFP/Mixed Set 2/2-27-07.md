Supplemental oxygen

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is responsible for approximately 2.1 million health care encounters annually in the United States. The child in this case has a typical presentation of RSV bronchiolitis. The diagnosis can be made clinically, although specific testing for RSV is often used in the hospital setting to segregate RSV-infected patients from others. Management is primarily supportive, especially including maintenance of hydration and oxygenation. Bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antiviral agents do not have a significant impact on symptoms or the disease course. Ribavirin is not recommended for routine use due to its expense, conflicting data on effectiveness, and potential toxicity to exposed health care workers. Antibiotics are of no benefit in the absence of bacterial superinfection.
