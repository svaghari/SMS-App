TSH

The concentration of lithium into the thyroid gland inhibits iodine uptake, iodotyrosine coupling, and thyroid hormone secretion. Thyroglobulin structure is also affected by lithium. The effect can be significant enough to produce a state of hypothyroidism and/or goiter, and studies have shown that as many as two-thirds of patients develop hypothyroidism within 10 years of beginning lithium treatment. Routine monitoring of TSH and T4 every 6â€“12 months is a recommended standard for all patients receiving lithium treatment. Lithium administration would not be expected to directly affect any of the other blood levels listed, so the indications for obtaining these tests are the same as for other patients.
