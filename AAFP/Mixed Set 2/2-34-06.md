pH 7.50, pCO2 25 mm Hg, pO2 100 mm Hg

Anxiety, shortness of breath, paresthesia, and carpopedal spasm are characteristic of hyperventilation. Respiratory alkalosis secondary to hyperventilation is diagnosed when arterial pH is elevated and pCO2 is depressed. Low pH is characteristic of acidosis, either respiratory or metabolic, and elevated pH with elevated pCO2 is characteristic of metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation.
