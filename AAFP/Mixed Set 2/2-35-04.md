High-dose oral amoxicillin

Oral antibiotics are preferred for community-acquired pneumonia if the patient is able to take them. The antibiotic of choice is amoxicillin for children 60 days to 5 years of age because of its activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Azithromycin is the antibiotic of choice for children 5â€“16 years old because of its activity against Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and it can be used in children between the ages of 60 days and 5 years who are allergic to penicillin. Ceftriaxone is not a preferred antibiotic.
