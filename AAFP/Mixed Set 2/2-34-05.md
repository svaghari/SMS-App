Acetaminophen

Acetaminophen is the analgesic of choice for short-term treatment of mild to moderate pain in patients with stage 3â€“5 chronic kidney disease. Chronic nonterminal pain requires initial treatment with nonopioid analgesics. NSAIDs should be avoided because of the risk of nephrotoxicity.
