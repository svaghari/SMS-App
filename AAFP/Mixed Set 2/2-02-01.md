Cluster headache

This patient has cluster headaches. Most people with cluster headaches are male. These headaches typically present with severe unilateral pain that lasts from 15 minutes to 3 hours. The pain is generally extremely sharp, continuous, and incapacitating. In addition to the pain, the headaches are associated with at least one of the following ipsilateral signs: conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, miosis or ptosis, eye edema, and forehead and facial sweating. Patients may also have a sense of restlessness or agitation. The headaches occur anywhere from every other day up to 8 times a day, often in cycles for 4â€“12 weeks. Cluster headaches respond to most of the same medications as migraine headaches (DHE, ergotamines, triptans). They also respond well to 100% oxygen therapy.

Paroxysmal hemicranias are very unusual and present with a similar type of pain, but the attacks are usually short and they are more common in women. Medication rebound headaches tend to be diffuse, bilateral, almost daily headaches. These occur in people who are overusing medications, and they tend to get worse with physical or mental exertion. Temporal arteritis usually occurs in older adults. Migraines are also often unilateral but they are usually pulsatile, and are associated with nausea and vomiting or photophobia and phonophobia.
