A plasma aldosterone/renin ratio

Primary hyperaldosteronism is the most common cause of secondary hypertension in the middle-aged population, and can be diagnosed from a renin/aldosterone ratio. This diagnosis is further suggested by the finding of hypokalemia, which suggests hyperaldosteronism even though it is not present in the majority of cases.

An echocardiogram would help make a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta, but this is more common in younger patients. Renal MRA may demonstrate renal artery stenosis, but this condition is more common in older patients. Sleep apnea is increasing in prevalence along with the rise in obesity, but it is not suggested by this case. A 24-hour urine catecholamine test is used to diagnose pheochromocytoma, which is not suggested by this patientâ€™s findings. Pheochromocytoma is also less common than aldosteronism (SOR C).
