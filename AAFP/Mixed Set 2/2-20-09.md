Hydrocortisone

Common features of acute adrenal insufficiency include fatigue and lack of energy, weight loss, hypotension, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Other features such as dry skin, hyperpigmentation, and abdominal pain are seen to varying degrees. Common laboratory findings include electrolyte disturbances, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, azotemia, anemia, and eosinophilia. Patients can also have unexplained hypoglycemia. Patients with advanced-stage cancer (especially of the lung or breast) may develop acute adrenal insufficiency from metastatic infiltration of the adrenal glands. Intravenous hydrocortisone is the treatment of choice in the management of adrenal crisis. For managing hypotension, dopamine is recommended for patients with sepsis, dobutamine for those in cardiogenic shock, and packed RBCs for those with hemorrhagic shock. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are part of the therapy for sepsis, but are not first-line agents for hypotension (SOR B).
