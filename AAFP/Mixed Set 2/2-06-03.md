Rotavirus vaccine

In general, when young children are found to be behind schedule in receiving recommended immunizations, catch-up immunization is important. However, the rotavirus series should not be started past 15 weeks of age, or continued past 8 months of age. This child should have received hepatitis B vaccine at 6 months of age, and should be given a catch-up dose. The MMR and varicella vaccines are recommended at the 12-month visit.
