Rheumatoid arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis is most often symmetric at presentation and particularly affects the wrists and other extremity joints that have a high ratio of synovium to articular cartilage. Rheumatoid factor is often negative in the early months of the disease, although it may be positive later. Radiographs and laboratory tests are helpful, but the diagnosis is primarily clinical. Osteoarthritis of the wrists usually involves the carpal-metacarpal joint of the thumb primarily, and the joint would be red if there were an injury. Fibromyalgia usually involves the soft tissue of the trunk, and there is no evidence of inflammation. Lyme disease can cause a variety of joint diseases, but not chronic symmetric arthritis.
