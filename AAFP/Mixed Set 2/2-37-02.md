Calcium citrate

Women over the age of 50 require at least 1200 mg of calcium a day. Inadequate calcium intake is common, particularly in older women, and is associated with increased bone loss and an increased fracture risk. Supplements should be considered when dietary intake is inadequate. Calcium carbonate is the least expensive and most commonly used supplement, but it is constipating and stomach acid improves its absorption. Calcium gluconate and calcium lactate are rarely used for fracture prevention or calcium supplementation. Bone meal and oyster shell calcium are primarily composed of calcium carbonate but may contain lead or other contaminants since they are derived from natural sources. In addition, their absorption without stomach acid is erratic.

Calcium citrate is less dependent on stomach acidity for absorption and it may be used with long-term gastric acid suppression agents. It may be taken without regard to food or meals.
