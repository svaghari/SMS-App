Have no benefit

Once considered generally beneficial to the running athlete, preparticipation static stretching has been found lacking in terms of benefit and even detrimental when subjected to scientific study. There is strong evidence that static stretching significantly slows performance in sprints up to 100 meters. Studies have failed to demonstrate that static stretching before running significantly decreases the likelihood of muscular injury of the lower limbs or results in a measurable reduction of delayed-onset muscle soreness. Limited evidence suggests that preparticipation static stretching, when performed alone, adversely affects both strength and endurance in elite athletes but has little measurable effect on amateur and casual athletes. Based on current understanding of sports performance, static stretching is of most benefit when performed during the cool-down period following exercise, which has been found to increase flexibility, and is best avoided immediately before athletic endeavors. A preparatory aerobic warm-up combined with dynamic range-of-motion exercises may be of some benefit for runners.
