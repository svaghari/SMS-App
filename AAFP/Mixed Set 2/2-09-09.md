Azithromycin (Zithromax)

Community-acquired pneumonia in children over the age of 5 is most commonly due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Less common bacterial infections include Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and group A Streptococcus. Initial treatment with antibiotics is empiric, as the pathogen is usually unknown at the time of diagnosis. The choice in children is based on age, severity of illness, and local patterns of resistance. Children age 5â€“16 years who can be treated as outpatients are usually treated with oral azithromycin. For patients requiring inpatient management, intravenous cefuroxime plus either intravenous erythromycin or azithromycin is recommended
