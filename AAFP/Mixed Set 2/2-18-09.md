Analgesics and supportive care only

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assembled a panel of national health experts to develop evidence-based guidelines for evaluating and treating adults with acute respiratory disease. According to these guidelines, the most reliable clinical predictors of streptococcal pharyngitis are the Centor criteria. These include tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, absence of cough, and history of fever. The presence of three or four of these criteria has a positive predictive value of 40%–60%, and the absence of three or four of these criteria has a negative predictive value of 80%.

Patients with four positive criteria should be treated with antibiotics, those with three positive criteria should be tested and treated if positive, and those with 0–1 positive criteria should be treated with analgesics and supportive care only. This patient has only one of the Centor criteria, and should therefore not be tested or treated with antibiotics.
