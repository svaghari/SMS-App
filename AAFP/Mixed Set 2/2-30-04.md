cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is not that rare, and has both surgical and nonsurgical causes. It results from a direct communication between the subarachnoid space and the paranasal sinuses. Accidental trauma causes 70%–80% of CSF rhinorrhea cases, with 2%–4% of acute head injuries resulting in CSF rhinorrhea. Nontraumatic CSF rhinorrhea includes high-pressure and normopressure leaks from causes including tumors, processes including boney erosion, empty sella syndrome, and congenital defects including meningoceles. The rhinorrhea is clear and often has a sweet or salty taste. The drainage can be continuous or intermittent, and is often associated with a gush when changing from a recumbent to an upright position. CSF rhinorrhea can lead to meningitis or other infections by serving as a pathway for bacteria.
