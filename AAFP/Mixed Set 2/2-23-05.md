Hip fracture

While hormonal therapy was initially used to treat postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms, it was also believed to prevent disease. Based on retrospective studies, a decrease in ischemic heart disease and dementia was suspected. The Women’s Health Initiative trials, first undertaken in the 1990s, showed that this was unfortunately not the case, and that hormone therapy actually increases the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, gallbladder disease, dementia, and venous thrombosis, particularly in older women. A decrease in fractures was demonstrated, however, along with some other health benefits, such as a reduced risk of endometrial cancer.
