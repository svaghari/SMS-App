Resistance training

Many types of exercise programs are beneficial for older adults, including simply walking for 30 minutes three times a week. However, a meta-analysis of progressive resistance training programs in nursing homes showed that there were significant improvements in muscle strength, chair-to-stand time, stair climbing, gait speed, and balance. This is seen even in those with advanced age, disabilities, chronic diseases, or extremely sedentary lifestyles.
