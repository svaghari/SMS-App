Haemophilus influenzae

Conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been highly effective in reducing the incidence of bacterial meningitis in young children and are now routinely recommended for infants and older patients who fall into appropriate risk groups (SOR B). Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes also cause meningitis in young children, but there is not currently a routine vaccine for these pathogens. Likewise, Borrelia burgdorferi and Mycoplasma pneumoniae can cause aseptic meningitis, but there is no routine vaccine.
