Continue the current dosage of levothyroxine

Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy impairs fetal development and increases the risk of spontaneous miscarriage, prematurity, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and postpartum hemorrhage. These risks are mitigated by appropriate levothyroxine treatment. Levothyroxine/LÂ¬triiodothyroxine combinations and desiccated thyroid preparations have the potential to correct maternal hypothyroidism, but the T4 level may still be too low to provide the transplacental delivery necessary for optimal fetal health. The most appropriate pregnancy planning advice is to continue the current dosage of levothyroxine with a plan for monthly monitoring of TSH and T4 during pregnancy, with the expectation that an increase in dosage may be required as the pregnancy progresses.
