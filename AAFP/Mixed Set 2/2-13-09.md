Metronidazole

Metronidazole, vancomycin, and fidaxomicin are the three medications recommended for treatment of
Clostridium difficile colitis infections. Only metronidazole is effective intravenously, because its biliary
excretion and possibly exudation through the colonic mucosa allows it to reach the colon via the
bloodstream. Treatment for this condition with vancomycin and fidaxomicin is oral. Imipenem/cilastatin,
ciprofloxacin, and meropenem have not been shown to be effective for C. difficile infection.
