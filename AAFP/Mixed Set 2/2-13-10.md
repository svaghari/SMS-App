Therapeutic ultrasound

Calcaneal apophysitis, also called Severâ€™s disease, is a common cause of heel pain in young athletes, especially those who participate in basketball, soccer, track, and other sports that involve running. Typically the heel apophysis closes by age 15. Treatment options include activity modification, the use of ice packs and/or moist heat, stretching, analgesics, and orthotic devices. The use of therapeutic ultrasound on the active bone growth plates in children is contraindicated.
