MRI of the thoracic spine

This patient has symptoms and signs consistent with a spinal cord lesion. With rapidly progressing symptoms of paraparesis and sensory abnormalities in a diabetic patient, an epidural abscess is likely. This is considered a neurologic emergency, because a permanent deficit can result if the problem is not addressed promptly. MRI of the thoracic spine, which is the level of her deficits, is the best next step in the evaluation of this patient. Intravenous antibiotics are a necessary treatment, along with surgical debridement, if the MRI demonstrates the underlying problem. Thoracic spinal films are not helpful in this situation. Neither antiplatelet therapy nor corticosteroids are indicated for a spinal epidural abscess.
