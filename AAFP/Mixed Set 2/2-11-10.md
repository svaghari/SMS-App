She does not need screening ultrasonography at this time

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommend not performing carotid artery screening with ultrasonography or other screening tests in patients without neurologic symptoms because the harms outweigh the benefits. In the general population, screening tests for carotid artery stenosis would result in more false-positive results than true-positive results. This would lead to surgical procedures that are not indicated or to confirmatory angiography. As a result of these procedures, some patients would suffer serious harms such as death, stroke, or myocardial infarction, which outweigh the potential benefit surgical treatment may have in preventing stroke.
