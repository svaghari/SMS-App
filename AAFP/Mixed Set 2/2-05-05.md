Testing for diabetes mellitus should be considered in all asymptomatic adults who have a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and have one or more additional risk factors such as physical inactivity, a first degree relative with diabetes, a high-risk ethnicity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or polycystic ovary syndrome. In asymptomatic patients with no risk factors, screening should begin at age 45.
