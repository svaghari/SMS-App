The cycle of continuous quality improvement

Improving quality and efficiency in medicine is best done using a systems approach. One of the tools for improving a system of care is to utilize the “Plan-Do-Check-Act” cycle of continuous quality improvement. This cycle includes a planning stage to identify an improvement strategy. An implementation stage is followed by a time of evaluation for effectiveness. Finally, a decision is made to adopt or abandon the initial strategy. The cycle is then repeated as many times as necessary to attain the desired results.
