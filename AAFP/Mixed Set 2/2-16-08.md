Long-term indwelling Foley catheter placement

While it would increase the risk of urinary infection, indwelling catheter placement is most likely to provide immediate relief of this patientâ€™s urinary retention. It will minimize or prevent further contamination of his decubitus ulcer with urine. Prostatectomy may relieve the urethral obstruction, but this patient is likely to remain incontinent due to his vascular dementia. Doxazosin or finasteride would likely be inadequate in this situation. Tolterodine is not indicated for overflow incontinence.
