2

Muscle strength is scored on a scale of 0 to 5. The inability to contract a muscle is scored as 0. Contraction without movement constitutes grade 1 strength. Movement with the effect of gravity neutralized is grade 2 strength, while movement against gravity only is grade 3 strength. Movement against gravity plus some additional resistance indicates grade 4 strength. Normal, or grade 5, strength is demonstrated by movement against substantial resistance.
