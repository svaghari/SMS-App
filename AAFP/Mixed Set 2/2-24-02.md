No repeat echocardiography

The American Society of Echocardiography recommends that physicians NOT order follow-up or serial echocardiograms for surveillance after a finding of trace valvular regurgitation on an initial echocardiogram (SOR C). Trace mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonic regurgitation can be detected in 70%â€“90% of normal individuals and has no adverse clinical implications. The clinical significance of a small amount of aortic regurgitation with an otherwise normal echocardiographic study is unknown.
