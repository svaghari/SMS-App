Treatment based on clinical findings

The diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is based primarily on the clinical evaluation. Significant consequences can occur if treatment is delayed. Physicians should therefore treat on the basis of clinical judgment without waiting for confirmation from laboratory or imaging tests (SOR B). No single symptom, physical finding, or laboratory test is sensitive or specific enough to definitively diagnose PID (SOR C). Clinical diagnosis alone based on the history, physical examination, and office laboratory results is 87% sensitive, transvaginal ultrasonography is 30% sensitive, and laparoscopy is 81% sensitive but unnecessarily invasive and not cost-effective. A study examining the diagnostic performance of CT in acute PID concluded that the overall sensitivity of CT is poor.
