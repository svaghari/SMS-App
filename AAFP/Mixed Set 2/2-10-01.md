Haloperidol

This patient is experiencing delirium, which is common in the last weeks of life, occurring in 26%â€“44% of persons hospitalized with advanced cancer and in up to 88% of persons with a terminal illness. In studies of a palliative care population it was possible to determine a cause for delirium in less than 50% of cases. There is a consensus based on observational evidence and experience that antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol are effective for the management of delirium, and they are widely used. However, there have been few randomized, controlled trials to assess their effectiveness.

While benzodiazepines are used extensively in persons with delirium who are terminally ill, there is no evidence from well-conducted trials that they are beneficial. Trazodone is an antidepressant that is sometimes used for insomnia. Scopolamine is an anticholinergic that is used to reduce respiratory secretions in hospice patients, but its anticholinergic side effects would increase delirium severity. Amitriptyline also has significant anticholinergic properties.
