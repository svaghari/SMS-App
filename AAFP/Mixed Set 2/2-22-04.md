10 years

There is substantial evidence that small (<10 mm) hyperplastic polyps found in the rectum or sigmoid colon are not neoplastic. Data obtained from numerous studies provides considerable evidence of moderate quality that individuals with no significant findings other than rectal or sigmoid hyperplastic polyps of this size should be included in the same low-risk cohort as those who have an unremarkable colonoscopy. For patients at low risk the recommended interval between screening colonoscopies is 10 years. Reductions in this interval are recommended for patients with one or two small tubular adenomas (5–10 years) or those with three or more tubular adenomas (3 years); the interval for more extensive disease is best individualized but can be as often as annually in unusual cases.
