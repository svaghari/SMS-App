Duloxetine (Cymbalta)

The best pharmacologic agent for this patient is duloxetine, as it is indicated for both depression and
chronic pain and is unlikely to cause weight gain. The other agents listed can cause weight gain to varying
degrees, and the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline is on the Beers list of drugs not recommended for
elderly patients (SOR A).
