Lichen simplex chronicus

This patient has lichen simplex chronicus, consisting of lichenified plaques and excoriations that result from excessive scratching. Treatment focuses on stopping the itch-scratch cycle. Topical corticosteroids under an occlusive dressing or intralesional corticosteroids can be helpful. Scabies lesions are small, erythematous papules that are frequently excoriated. Contact dermatitis is usually associated with direct skin exposure to an allergen or irritant and is typically localized to the area of exposure. Chronic urticaria causes a typical circumscribed, raised, erythematous lesion with central pallor.
