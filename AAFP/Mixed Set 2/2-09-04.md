Gastroesophageal reflux disease

There are many causes of wheezing in infants and children. Wheezing associated with feeding is most commonly due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (level of evidence 3). Tracheoesophageal fistula and laryngeal cleft also cause wheezing associated with feeding, but are rare. Foreign body aspiration is most common between 8 months and 4 years of age and the child is most likely to have a history of the sudden onset of wheezing associated with choking. The wheezing present with tracheomalacia is position related.
