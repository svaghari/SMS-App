Doxylamine (Unisom) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6)

Nausea and vomiting are common in early pregnancy and can affect the health of both the pregnant woman and the fetus. Mild cases of nausea and vomiting can be controlled with lifestyle and dietary changes. It is recommended that patients eat frequent small meals consisting of dry and bland foods, avoid spicy and fatty foods, eat high-protein snacks, and eat crackers in the morning before rising. If the nausea and vomiting are not controlled with dietary modifications, the first-line treatment is vitamin B6, 10–25 mg, and doxylamine, 12.5 mg, 3–4 times per day. The other antiemetics can also be used in pregnancy, but vitamin B6 and doxylamine should be tried first because of the balance of safety and efficacy.
