Intralesional corticosteroid injection

The patientâ€™s history and physical findings are all consistent with a keloid, which is a benign overgrowth of scar tissue at sites of trauma to the skin, such as acne, burns, surgery, ear piercing, tattoos, and infections. Common locations include the earlobes, jawline, nape of the neck, scalp, chest, and back. Lesions are sometimes asymptomatic, but often are associated with hypersensitivity, pain, and pruritus. The incidence is higher in Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. Intralesional corticosteroid injections are first-line therapy. Silicone gel sheeting, topical imiquimod, and intralesional fluorouracil can be used when first-line therapy fails, but these methods are more often associated with recurrence. Laser therapy and surgical excision are associated with a high rate of recurrence when used as monotherapy.
