Coordinating a patient’s care across all elements of the health care system

The concept of a medical home was first suggested by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1967 to describe the ideal care of children with disabilities. In 2004 the Future of Family Medicine Project adapted this concept to describe how primary care should be based on “continuous, relationship-centered, whole-system, comprehensive care for communities.” In 2007 all of the major primary care organizations collaborated to define the foundational principles of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH). These principles include the following:

Comprehensiveness: Most preventive, acute, and chronic care for individual patients can be performed
at the PCMH. Patient Centered: The PCMH provides care that is relationship-based, with an orientation toward the whole
person. Coordination: The PCMH coordinates care for patients across all elements of the health care system. Accessibility: The PCMH works to provide patients with timely access to providers. Quality: The PCMH continuously works to improve care quality and safety.
