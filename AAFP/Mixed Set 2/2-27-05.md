Verapamil (Calan, Verelan)

This patient suffers from cluster headaches. Both verapamil and lithium are the mainstays of treatment for chronic cluster headaches, but of the options listed, only verapamil is indicated for the prevention of cluster headaches, and it is actually the first-line prophylactic agent (SOR A). Oxygen and sumatriptan are first-line abortive therapies for cluster headaches (SOR A).
