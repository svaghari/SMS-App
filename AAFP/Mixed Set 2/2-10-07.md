Subacromial bursitis

Acute subacromial bursitis is common and is often associated with calcific deposits in the supraspinatus tendon, pain on abduction, and local tenderness. Bicipital tendinitis results in tenderness on palpation of the tendon of the long head of the biceps. A rotator cuff tear usually results from an injury, and affects range of motion. Osteoarthritis seldom causes acute, severe pain. A frozen shoulder may result from subacromial bursitis and presents with limitation of shoulder motion.
