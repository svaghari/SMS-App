Reassurance and antipyretics

This patient is experiencing the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction—an acute, transient, febrile reaction that occurs within the first few hours after treatment for syphilis. The condition peaks at 6–8 hours and disappears within 12–24 hours after therapy. The temperature elevation is usually low grade, and there is often associated myalgia, headache, and malaise. It is usually of no clinical significance and may be treated with salicylates in most cases. The pathogenesis of the reaction is unclear, but it may be due to liberation of antigens from the spirochetes.
