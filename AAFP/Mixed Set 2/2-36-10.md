transabdominal ultrasonography

The American College of Gastroenterology recommends transabdominal ultrasonography for all patients with acute pancreatitis (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI should be reserved for patients who have an unclear diagnosis, are not clinically improving after 48â€“72 hours, or develop complications.
