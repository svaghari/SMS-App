Avoiding indwelling urinary catheter placement

The Society of Hospital Medicine recommends that urinary catheters not be placed or left in place for managing incontinence or for staff convenience, or for monitoring output in patients who are not critically ill. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends using patient weight to monitor diuresis. Acceptable indications for an indwelling catheter include critical illness, obstruction, hospice care, and perioperatively for <2 days for urologic procedures.
