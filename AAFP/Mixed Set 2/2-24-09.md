Fourth

In a corneal light reflex test, the patientâ€™s attention is attracted to a target while a light is directed at the eyes. In normally aligned eyes the light reflex will be located in the center of each pupil. In patients with esotropia the reflex will be over the lateral portion of the iris in the affected eye. In exotropia the light reflex is over the medial iris, in hypertropia it is over the inferior iris, and in hypotropia it is over the superior iris. The finding observed in this child, hypertropia, will occur with a congenital palsy involving the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the fourth cranial nerve.
