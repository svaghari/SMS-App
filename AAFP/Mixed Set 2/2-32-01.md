Hormonal contraceptives

Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line therapy for menstrual abnormalities, hirsutism, and acne in polycystic ovary syndrome. Clomiphene is used for infertility. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall. Metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and menstrual irregularities, but does not improve hirsutism or acne. Spironolactone may be used as an add-on to hormonal contraceptives for treatment of hirsutism and acne.
