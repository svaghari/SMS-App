Discontinue the amoxicillin and note amoxicillin as a potential allergy in her record

The cause of this patientâ€™s rash is difficult to determine. There are many infections that could result in a cutaneous reaction similar to what she is experiencing. Scarlet fever is caused by a systemic reaction to Streptococcus. In this case, however, the patient is already taking an antibiotic for streptococcal disease so the emergence of new symptoms over a week after starting therapy is highly unlikely. A viral exanthem could also cause a skin rash similar to the one described here. Unfortunately, differentiating between a drug-induced rash and a viral exanthem is not clinically possible. If this differentiation is necessary, the patient should undergo a skin biopsy and allergy testing to determine the offending agent. However, since this approach is impractical in the ambulatory setting, it is most straightforward to discontinue the agent she is on and list it as a potential allergy. An alternative antibiotic such as erythromycin could be used to complete the course of treatment at the discretion of the physician.
