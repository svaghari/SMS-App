Continue sulfasalazine and arrange for colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a lifelong condition that results in a waxing and waning autoimmune inflammation of the colon. Clinical symptoms are inadequate for assessing the need for ongoing therapy. For this reason, once a patient with UC has achieved remission with a specific medication, that medication should be continued indefinitely unless the disease resurfaces. Sulfasalazine is one of the most effective agents for this purpose, is usually well tolerated, and is considered first-line therapy for ulcerative colitis. There is no apparent reason to consider a higher order of therapy (azathioprine) in this patient or to refer her for colectomy. Patients with UC who have had a history of moderate or extensive involvement of the colon, however, are at markedly increased risk for the development of colorectal cancer. Current guidelines recommend beginning screening colonoscopy 10 years after the initial diagnosis and continuing every 2â€“5 years, with the interval based on the findings.
