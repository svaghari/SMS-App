A CBC and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate

This presentation is typical of either transient synovitis or septic arthritis of the hip. Because the conditions have very different treatment regimens and outcomes, it is important to differentiate the two. It is recommended that after plain films, the first studies to be performed should be a CBC and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Studies have shown that septic arthritis should be considered highly likely in a child who has a fever >38.7°C (101.7°F), refuses to bear weight on the affected leg, has a WBC count >12,000 cells/mm3, and has an ESR >40 mm/hr. If several or all of these conditions exist, aspiration of the hip guided by ultrasonography or fluoroscopy should be performed by an experienced practitioner. MRI may be helpful when the diagnosis is unclear based on the initial evaluation, or if other etiologies need to be excluded.
