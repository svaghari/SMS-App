Cervical spine imaging

While all of the options listed may have some value in evaluating the preoperative status of a patient with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis, imaging of the patient’s cervical spine to detect atlantoaxial subluxation would be most important for preventing a catastrophic spinal cord injury during intubation. In many cases cervical fusion must be performed before other elective procedures can be contemplated. Although rheumatoid arthritis may influence oxygen saturation and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, these tests would not alert the surgical team to the possibility of significant operative morbidity and mortality. Resting pulse rate and a rheumatoid factor titer are unlikely to be significant factors in this preoperative scenario.
