Early initiation of a low-fat diet

Historically, patients with acute pancreatitis were kept NPO to rest the pancreas. Evidence now shows that
bowel rest is associated with intestinal mucosal atrophy and increased infectious complications because of
bacterial translocation from the gut. Multiple studies have shown that patients who are provided oral
feeding early in the course of acute pancreatitis have a shorter hospital stay, decreased infectious
complications, decreased morbidity, and decreased mortality. Starting with a low-fat solid diet has been
shown to be safe compared with clear liquids, providing more calories and shortening hospital stays.
Total parenteral nutrition should be avoided in patients with mild or severe acute pancreatitis. There have
been multiple randomized trials showing that total parenteral nutrition is associated with infectious and
other line-related complications.
