A third heart sound (S3 gallop)

Among the constellation of history and physical findings that can be found in patients with heart failure, none provides a proof-positive diagnosis alone, as most are found in other disease states as well. Each of the options listed raises the possibility of heart failure but the only one that has a specificity >90% is the third heart sound, which is 99% specific for the diagnosis of heart failure. Other findings with >90% sensitivity include a displaced point of maximal impulse, interstitial edema or venous congestion on a chest radiograph, jugular vein distention, and hepatojugular reflux. The other options listed here have specificities for heart failure that fall within the range of 65%â€“80%.
