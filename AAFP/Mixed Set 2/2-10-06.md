Donepezil (Aricept)

Anticholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil are considered first-line therapy for patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (SOR A). Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist and is often used in combination with anticholinesterase inhibitors for moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease, but it has not been shown to be effective as a single agent for patients with mild to moderate disease. There is not enough evidence to support the use of selegiline, a monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor, in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Risperidone and other antipsychotic medications are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, but can sometimes be helpful in controlling associated behavioral symptoms. Studies of ginkgo biloba extract have not shown a consistent, clinically significant benefit in persons with Alzheimer’s disease.
