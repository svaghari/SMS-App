oseltamivir, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin (Vancocin)

This patient has pneumonia, sepsis, and suspected coinfection with influenza. Although the rapid antigen-based nasal swab was negative, false-negative rates may be as high as 70% and this test should not be relied upon to rule out influenza. Treatment should include both antiviral and antibacterial agents that include coverage against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the most common bacterial pathogen isolated from critically ill patients with coinfection. Oseltamivir, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin should be initiated empirically for the pneumonia and sepsis. The criteria for sepsis are satisfied by a temperature >38.3Â°C, a WBC count >12,000/mm3, a respiratory rate >20/min, and a source of probable infection.
