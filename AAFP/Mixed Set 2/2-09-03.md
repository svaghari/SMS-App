Pregabalin (Lyrica)

This patient’s condition is consistent with distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN). It may be present in up to 10%–15% of newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in up to 50% of patients within 10 years of diagnosis. Pregabalin or duloxetine is recommended as the initial approach in the symptomatic treatment of neuropathic pain in diabetes (SOR A). There is no significant evidence supporting glycemic control or lifestyle interventions as effective treatment for the condition. Narcotics, including tramadol, are not first- or second-line choices, and although tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline are effective, they present a higher risk for serious side effects, especially in the elderly. There are no recommendations for the use of NSAIDs.
