Radiofrequency ablation

This patient presents with a classic description of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The initial management of SVT centers around stopping the aberrant rhythm. In the hemodynamically stable patient initial measures should include vagal maneuvers (SOR C), intravenous adenosine or verapamil (SOR B), intravenous diltiazem or Î²-blockade, intravenous antiarrhythmics, or cardioversion in refractory cases. While digoxin is occasionally useful in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, it is not recommended for SVT. Radiofrequency ablation is fast becoming the first-line therapy for all patients with recurrent SVT, not just those refractory to suppressive drug therapies. Observational studies have shown that this therapy results in improved quality of life and lower cost as compared to drug therapy (SOR B).
