Cefuroxime (Ceftin

Recent reports indicate that the risk of a serious allergic reaction to second-and third-generation cephalosporins in patients with penicillin or amoxicillin allergy appears to be almost nil, and no greater than the risk among patients without such allergies. While patients with a history of a serious type I immediate or accelerated (anaphylactoid) reaction to amoxicillin can be safely treated with cefdinir, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime, some physicians may wish to recommend an allergy referral to determine tolerance before initiation of therapy. Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae are often resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin, and these agents are therefore not recommended for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in the penicillin-allergic patient. Doxycycline should not be used in children younger than 8 years of age except for anthrax and some tickborne infections. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is contraindicated in a penicillin-allergic patient.
