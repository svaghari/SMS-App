Discharge from the hospital on oral PPI therapy

Blood transfusions should be administered to patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding who have a hemoglobin level ≤7.0 g/dL (SOR C). According to the Rockall risk scoring system, this patient’s mortality risk from gastrointestinal bleeding is low, based on the following: age <60, systolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg, heart rate <100 beats/min, no shock, and no major comorbidities. The Mallory-Weiss tear adds no points to his total score, and the only stigmata of recent hemorrhage is a dark spot in an otherwise clean ulcer base, which also adds no points. His only scored finding is the presence of the ulcer, which adds a single point to his score.

Patients with low-risk peptic ulcer bleeding based on clinical and endoscopic criteria can be discharged from the hospital on the same day as endoscopy (SOR C). Routine second-look endoscopy is not recommended in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding who are not considered to be at high risk for rebleeding (SOR C). Arteriography with embolization is indicated only in patients with persistent bleeding.
