Hospital admission for observation

Some experts recommend inpatient observation for all children with apparent life-threatening events such as this. Hospital admission is not always necessary, however, for a short, self-correcting episode associated with feeding. Given the history of not breathing for 20–25 seconds, having a blue tongue and lips, and being limp, admitting the child for observation is appropriate.

Although child abuse is a concern, referral to child protective services is not mandatory. Laryngoscopy would not be routine, but might be appropriate in some cases depending on the history and physical findings. Many groups recommend home apnea monitoring after discharge for patients with more severe or undiagnosed cases.
