Exenatide (Byetta)

Given the information about this patient, such as her relatively recent diagnosis, her age, and her lack of macro-or microvascular complications, a more strict hemoglobin A1c goal is indicated. There are several oral and injectable medicines that are reasonable choices in this case. Exenatide is an injectable GLP-1 agonist that is associated with weight loss. Pioglitazone is also effective but is associated with fluid retention rather than weight loss. Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor that may be a reasonable option in this case, but is not associated with weight loss. Insulin, either basal only, mixed, or basal-bolus regimens, may also be the best option for the patient described, but it does cause weight gain. Cost is another major consideration in treatment decisions, but more information would be needed to address this issue.
