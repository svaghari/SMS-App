Medial meniscus tear

A medial meniscus tear is the most likely diagnosis in a patient older than 40 who was bearing weight when the injury occurred, was unable to continue the activity, and has a positive Thessaly test. This test is performed by having the patient stand on one leg and flex the knee to 20Â°, then internally and externally rotate the knee. The presence of swelling immediately after the injury makes an internal derangement of the knee more likely, so osteoarthritis is less probable. This patient is able to bear weight, so a fracture is also not likely. Either a collateral ligament tear or an anterior cruciate ligament tear is possible, but these are not as common in this situation.
