Prednisone

Inflammatory bowel disease is divided into two categories: Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Noncontiguous or “skip” lesions that are transmural in nature and are found throughout the gastrointestinal tract make a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease likely in this patient. Corticosteroids are more effective in inducing remission than placebo and 5-ASA products (SOR A). A Cochrane review revealed no difference between elemental and nonelemental diets with regard to symptom remission (SOR A). Anti-TNF agents such as infliximab should be considered in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease who do not respond to initial corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy, but these are not recommended for initial treatment. While antibiotics such as metronidazole are widely used for both their anti-inflammatory and anti-infectious properties, controlled trials have not demonstrated their effectiveness. Surgical intervention should be considered in patients with ulcerative colitis, but surgery is not indicated for Crohn’s disease.
