The test can neither confirm nor rule out pulmonary embolism

The likelihood ratio (LR) is the ratio of the probability of a specific test result in people who have a particular disease to the probability in people who do not. LRs correspond to the clinical impression of how well a test rules in or rules out a given disease. A test with an LR of 1.0 indicates that it does not change the probability of disease. The higher above 1 the LR is, the more likely it is that the disease is present (an LR >10 is considered good). Conversely, the lower the LR is below 1, the more likely it is that the disease is not present (an LR <0.1 is considered good). Likelihood ratios are alternative statistics for summarizing diagnostic accuracy, and have several particularly powerful properties that make them more useful clinically than other statistics.
