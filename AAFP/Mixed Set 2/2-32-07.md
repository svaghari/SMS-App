Reassurance, with no activity restrictions or treatment

Benign nocturnal limb pains of childhood (growing pains) occur in as many as one-third of children, most often between 4 and 6 years of age. The etiology is unknown, but the course does not parallel pubescent growth, as would be expected if bone growth were the source of the pain. Pain often awakens the child within hours of falling asleep following an active day. It is generally localized around the knees, most often in the shins and calves, but also may affect the thighs and the upper extremities. A characteristic history coupled with a normal physical examination will confirm the diagnosis. Reassurance that no additional tests or treatments are necessary and that the condition is self-limiting is the most appropriate response.
