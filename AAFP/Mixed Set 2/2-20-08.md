High-dose statin therapy

Statin drugs are effective for preventing stroke, which should be the key goal in this high-risk patient. They may stabilize the intimal wall. Rapid lowering of blood pressure could cause brain injury by reducing blood flow in patients with carotid stenosis. Any evidence of hypoperfusion needs to be corrected immediately. Combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and is not recommended for stroke prevention. Patients over age 70 have worse outcomes with carotid stenting than with endarterectomy. Occult patent ductus arteriosus has not been shown to be a significant risk factor for stroke.
