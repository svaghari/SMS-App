Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas

The presence of a solitary enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow’s node) is associated with a gastrointestinal system malignancy. When combined with painless jaundice and a palpable nontender gallbladder (Courvoisier’s sign), pancreatic cancer is the most likely diagnosis.

A pancreatic pseudocyst develops after repeated bouts of pancreatitis and is not directly associated with jaundice. Biliary cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma typically present with pain, fatigue, malaise, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and eventually ascites. The jaundice of biliary cirrhosis is generally accompanied by severe pruritus. In neither condition is a palpably enlarged gallbladder present. Ascending cholangitis presents with a high fever, right upper quadrant pain, and an overall toxic, septic picture, often accompanied by delirium and rigors.
