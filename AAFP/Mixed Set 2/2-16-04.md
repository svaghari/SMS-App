Continuing the current therapy

Some hypothyroid patients who are treated with appropriate dosages of levothyroxine and whose TSH levels are in the appropriate range continue to have persistent symptoms such as fatigue, depressed mood, and weight gain. If the TSH is in the appropriate range then no adjustment is necessary and annual serum TSH testing is recommended. Patients who remain symptomatic on an appropriate dosage of levothyroxine, as determined by a TSH <2.5 mIU/L, are not likely to benefit from combination triiodothyronine/thyroxine therapy (SOR A). Desiccated thyroid hormone preparations are not recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the treatment of hypothyroidism. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized, controlled trials of combination T3/T4 therapy versus T4 monotherapy showed no improvements in pain, depression, or quality of life (SOR A).
