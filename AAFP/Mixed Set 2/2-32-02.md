Immediate induction of labor

This patient most likely has preeclampsia, which is defined as an elevated blood pressure and proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation. The patient needs further evaluation, including a 24-hour urine for quantitative measurement of protein or a spot urine protein to creatinine ratio, blood pressure monitoring, and laboratory evaluation that includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, a platelet count, and serum levels of transaminase, creatinine, albumin, LDH, and uric acid. A peripheral smear and coagulation profiles also may be obtained. Antepartum fetal testing, such as a nonstress test to assess fetal well-being, would also be appropriate.

Ultrasonography should be performed to assess for fetal intrauterine growth restriction, but only after an initial laboratory and fetal evaluation. Delivery is the definitive treatment for preeclampsia. The timing of delivery is determined by the gestational age of the fetus and the severity of preeclampsia in the mother. Vaginal delivery is preferred over cesarean delivery, if possible, in patients with preeclampsia. It is not necessary to start this patient on antihypertensive therapy at this point. An obstetric consultation should be considered for patients with preeclampsia.
