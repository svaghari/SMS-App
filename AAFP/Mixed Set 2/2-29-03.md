Cystoscopy

Patients with microscopic hematuria should initially be assessed for benign causes such as urinary tract infection, vigorous exercise, menstruation, and recent urologic procedures. If none of these is found, the next step would be assessing for renal disease using urine microscopy to look for casts or dysmorphic blood cells, and checking renal function. If the results are negative, CT urography and cystoscopy should be performed. CT evaluates the upper urinary tract for nephrolithiasis and renal cancer, while cystoscopy evaluates the bladder for bladder cancer, urethral strictures, and prostatic problems.

Urine cytology is less sensitive than cystoscopy for bladder cancer. This patient has normal renal function and no signs of renal disease on the urinalysis other than hematuria, so a nephrology consultation is not necessary at this time. Metformin use is not associated with microscopic hematuria. There is no role for antibiotics, given the negative urine culture.
