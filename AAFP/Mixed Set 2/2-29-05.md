Colonoscopy with biopsies

Inflammatory bowel disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the gastrointestinal tract, usually beginning in early adulthood. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are the most common of these conditions. Ulcerative colitis involves just the mucosa of the colon, starting at the anus and extending proximally to a variable distance. Crohn’s disease, on the other hand, may involve all layers of gastrointestinal tissue and can occur anywhere between the mouth and the anus. The diagnosis of either of these conditions is made by endoscopy with biopsies in order to best assess the extent and depth of inflammation.
