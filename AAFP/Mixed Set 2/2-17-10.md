diastolic dysfunction

Diastolic dysfunction is now recognized as an important cause of heart failure. It is due to left ventricular
hypertrophy as a response to chronic systolic hypertension. The ventricle becomes stiff and unable to relax
or fill adequately, thus limiting its forward output. The typical patient is an elderly person who has systolic
hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and a normal ejection fraction (50%â€“55%).
