Spironolactone (Aldactone)

Antiandrogens such as spironolactone, along with oral contraceptives, are recommended for the treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women (SOR C). Women should avoid becoming pregnant while on spironolactone because of the potential for teratogenic effects. In addition to having side effects, prednisone is only minimally helpful for reducing hirsutism by suppressing adrenal androgens. Leuprolide, although better than placebo, has many side effects and is expensive. Metformin can be used to treat patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, but this patient does not meet the criteria for this diagnosis.
