Improvement when sitting up and leaning forward

While there is substantial overlap in the signs, symptoms, and physical findings for the various etiologies of chest pain, a good history and physical examination can help determine which patients require immediate further evaluation for a potentially serious cause. The chest pain associated with pericarditis is typically pleuritic, and is worse with inspiration or in positions that put traction on the pleuropericardial tissues, such as lying supine. Patients with acute pericarditis typically get relief or improvement when there is less tension on the pericardium, such as when sitting and leaning forward. This position brings the heart closer to the anterior chest wall, which incidentally is the best position for hearing the pericardial friction rub associated with acute pericarditis.

Radiation of chest pain to both arms should raise concerns about myocardial ischemia or infarction. Radiation to the right scapula is sometimes seen with cholelithiasis. Worsening pain with the Valsalva maneuver is nonspecific and is of no particular diagnostic value.
