coccidioidomycosis

Knowledge of endemic fungi capable of causing infection in otherwise healthy patients can be very helpful
in ensuring an appropriate evaluation. Coccidioidomycosis is a common infection in the southwestern
United States. In addition to the symptoms in this patient, coccidioidomycosis can also present with a rash
such as erythema nodosum. Histoplasmosis is most common in the Midwest and with low-level exposure
symptoms are usually mild or absent. Blastomycosis is also present in the Midwest, as well as in the
Atlantic and southeastern states. Symptoms include an abrupt onset of fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain,
arthralgias, and myalgias. The cough is initially nonproductive but frequently becomes purulent.
Cryptococcosis and mucormycosis are more opportunistic infections occurring in immunocompromised
hosts.
