The inability to take 4 steps at the time of the injury and during the evaluation

The Ottawa ankle rules are 99% sensitive and 58% specific for identifying a fracture. They state that ankle radiography should be performed when a patient presents with pain in the malleolar region and has either point tenderness over the tip of the malleolus or the posterior edge of the affected bone (distal 6 cm), or is unable to bear weight at the time of injury and while being evaluated in the emergency department or office. Inability to bear weight is defined as the inability to take four steps. A limp when weight is transferred to the affected extremity still counts as being able to bear weight.
