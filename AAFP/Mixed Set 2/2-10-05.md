Carbamazepine (Tegretol)

People taking carbamazepine have a five-to eightfold increased risk of developing agranulocytosis. Baseline values including a CBC, serum electrolytes, and liver enzymes should be obtained before the drug is started, and the patient should be monitored with periodic hematologic testing. The other medications listed are not associated with agranulocytosis. Aripiprazole and olanzapine carry black box warnings for an increased risk of death in the elderly. Lithium is associated with lithium toxicity and thyroid dysfunction. Imipramine carries a warning for cardiac toxicity, and EKG monitoring is recommended.
