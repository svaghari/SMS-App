Penicillin

The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that penicillin remain the treatment of choice for group A streptococcal pharyngitis because of its proven efficacy, safety, narrow spectrum, and low cost. Penicillin-resistant group A Streptococcus has never been documented. Amoxicillin is often used in place of penicillin V as oral therapy for young children, primarily because of acceptance of the taste of the suspension. The other options listed are all possible regimens for group A streptococcal pharyngitis but penicillin is still considered the treatment of choice.
