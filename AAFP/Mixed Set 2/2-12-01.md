Vaginal estrogen

This patient has genitourinary syndrome of menopause (formerly termed vulvovaginal atrophy) based on her symptoms and examination. Estrogen therapy is highly effective for dyspareunia related to genitourinary syndrome of menopause, with the vaginal route preferred over systemic therapy if vaginal dryness is the primary concern. Bupropion and sildenafil may benefit women with sexual dysfunction induced by antidepressant medications. Data on the benefit of testosterone therapy is limited and inconsistent and lacks long-term information about safety. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been shown to effectively treat low sexual desire, but does not affect the physiologic changes associated with genitourinary syndrome of menopause.
