Hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate

The combination of the vasodilators hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate has been shown to be effective in the treatment of heart failure when standard treatment with diuretics, Î²-blockers, and an ACE inhibitor (or ARB) is insufficient to control symptoms or cannot be tolerated. This combination is particularly effective in African-Americans with NYHA class III or IV heart failure, with advantages including reduced mortality rates and improvement in quality-of-life measures. Digoxin, a long-time standard for the treatment of heart failure, is useful in reducing the symptoms of heart failure but has not been shown to improve survival. Amlodipine and other calcium channel blockers do not have a direct role in the treatment of heart failure.
