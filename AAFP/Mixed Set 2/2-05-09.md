SSRIs

The treatment of depression in pregnancy is determined by the severity of the symptoms and any past history of treatment response. For women who have a new onset of mild or moderate depression, it may be best to start with nonpharmacologic treatments such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy. These interventions may improve the depression enough that the patient will not need medications. However, in situations where pharmacologic treatment is clearly indicated, SSRIs are thought to have the best safety profile. Fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram have extensive data to support their safety in pregnancy and should be considered first line. Paroxetine is the one SSRI that is thought to carry an increased risk of congenital malformations with first-trimester exposure and should be avoided.

Tricyclic antidepressants are class D in pregnancy. SNRIs do not have as much safety data as SSRIs to support their use in pregnancy and would be considered a second-line choice. MAOIs are known teratogens and should be avoided in pregnancy. Stimulants are not first-line agents and should be avoided in pregnancy.
