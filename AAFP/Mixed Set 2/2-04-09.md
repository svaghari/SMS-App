Staphylococcus aureus

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of acute infectious endocarditis worldwide. Additionally, the most common cause of tricuspid valve endocarditis is intravenous drug abuse, and Staphylococcus aureus is the infecting organism in 80% of tricuspid valve infections. Streptococcus viridans is also a frequent cause of infectious endocarditis, with Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Cardiobacterium being less likely causes.
