Toxic metabolites of morphine

Morphine should be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency because the toxic metabolites morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide are not eliminated by the kidneys. Accumulation of these metabolites causes neuroexcitatory effects, including confusion, sedation, respiratory depression, and myoclonus.
