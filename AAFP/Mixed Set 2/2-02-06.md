Osteoporosis

Many minority populations in the United States, including Hispanics, suffer health care disparities. Some medical problems are also more common in certain populations. In 2009, Hispanics made up approximately 16% of the U.S. population and were the largest minority. This group is projected to make up 30% of the U.S. population by 2050. The rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus in Hispanics are disproportionately higher than those of non-Hispanic whites. Hypertension is closely linked to obesity, and Hispanics have higher rates of hypertension as well. Neurocysticercosis is the most common cause of seizures in Hispanic immigrants. Risk factors for osteoporosis include female gender, non-Hispanic white ethnicity, smoking, and low BMI.
