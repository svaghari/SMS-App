Petrolatum

The American Academy of Dermatology recommends against the routine use of topical antibiotics for clean surgical wounds, based on randomized, controlled trials. Topical antibiotics have not been shown to reduce the rate of infection in clean surgical wounds compared to the use of nonantibiotic ointment or no ointment. Studies have shown that white petrolatum ointment is as effective as antibiotic ointment in postprocedure care.
Topical antibiotics can aggravate open wounds, hindering the normal wound-healing process. In addition, there is a significant risk of developing contact dermatitis, as well as a potential for antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic treatment should be reserved for wounds that show signs of infection.
