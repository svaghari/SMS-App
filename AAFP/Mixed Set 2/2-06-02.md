A plain radiograph

Plain radiography should be the initial imaging modality to diagnose stress fractures (SOR C). One algorithm advocates radiography 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms (if symptoms persist), with repeat radiography the following week before performing more advanced imaging. An expert panel of the American College of Radiology recommends that MRI be considered next if plain radiography is negative.
