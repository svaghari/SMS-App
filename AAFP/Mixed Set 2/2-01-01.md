Methimazole (Tapazole)

Methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are the two oral antithyroid medications available. However, because of reports of severe hepatocellular damage, methimazole should be used instead of PTU unless it is contraindicated. Radioactive iodine treatment (131I) is an option, especially for patients who do not achieve remission with antithyroid medications. However, worsening of preexisting orbitopathy is a well-recognized potential complication of 131I treatment, as well as a transient increase in thyroid hormone levels that can precipitate thyroid storm. Thus, patients with elevated free T3 or free T4 levels should be treated with methimazole prior to 131I administration. Thyroidectomy is most often recommended for patients with thyroid nodules and those who are suspected of having cancer or who do not tolerate or refuse alternative forms of therapy. However, antithyroid medication should be given to achieve a euthyroid state prior to surgery in most patients.
