No preoperative medical testing

In general, recommended preoperative testing is based on the patient’s medical history and risk factors, the risk associated with the planned surgery, and the patient’s functional capacity. In the case of cataract surgery, however, randomized, controlled trials have established a lack of benefit from preoperative testing for patients in their normal state of health (SOR A).
