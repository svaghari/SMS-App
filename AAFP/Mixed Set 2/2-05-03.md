Citalopram (Celexa)

A Cochrane review of 15 studies involving 922 patients showed that antidepressants had a beneficial effect on the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Both SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants have shown benefit. Another Cochrane review of 12 randomized, controlled trials did not show any benefit from the use of fiber in any type of IBS. Antibiotics have been shown to have some beneficial effects, but neomycin is used only in constipation-predominant IBS. Lubiprostone is a selective C-2 chloride channel activator and can be used for patients with chronic constipation. Alosetron is a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 antagonist and is FDA approved to treat severe diarrhea-predominant IBS only in women who have not improved with conventional therapy. Alosetron is associated with uncommon but serious adverse events (ischemic colitis, constipation, death) and its use is restricted in the United States. Other potentially beneficial therapies for IBS include peppermint oil, psychological treatments, exercise, and probiotics.
