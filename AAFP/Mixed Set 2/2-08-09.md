Ciprofloxacin (Cipro)

Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin have been shown to significantly reduce the duration and severity of traveler’s diarrhea when given for 1–3 days. Sulfacetamide is available only in a topical form for use in the eye.  Penicillin and erythromycin are not effective against the most common cause of traveler’s diarrhea, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
