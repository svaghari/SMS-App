Modification of her running program and a quadriceps and hip strengthening program

This patient is suffering from patellofemoral pain syndrome, which causes anterior knee pain that is worse with running downhill. The examination is often normal, although there may be apprehension when the knee is extended with pressure over the patella and the patella will sometimes track laterally. Patellofemoral pain syndrome can be treated with exercises to strengthen the quadriceps and hips, and by using a knee sleeve with a doughnut-type cushion that the patella fits into. Static stretching would not address the problem. MRI would be indicated if there were joint-line pain or an unstable knee. Pes anserine bursitis usually causes pain and tenderness medially, below the joint line.
