Varenicline (Chantix)

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that clinicians screen all adults for tobacco use, advise smoking cessation, and provide behavioral therapy and FDA-approved pharmacotherapy if appropriate (A recommendation). Varenicline is an FDA-approved pharmacotherapy that is an effective option for smoking cessation with or without behavioral therapy. Although clonidine has been used for smoking cessation it is considered a second-line agent and is not FDA approved for smoking cessation. The USPSTF concluded that there was not enough evidence on the effect on smoking cessation to recommend an electronic nicotine delivery system (I recommendation). Abrupt and complete (“cold-turkey”) nicotine withdrawal is less effective than pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion hydrochloride, and varenicline). There is a lack of evidence regarding the efficacy of hypnotherapy.
