Symptomatic treatment only

Pharyngitis is a common complaint, and usually has a viral cause. The key factors in diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis are a fever over 100.4Â°F, tonsillar exudates, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and absence of cough. The scenario described is consistent with a viral infection, with no risk factors to make streptococcal infection likely; therefore, this patient should be offered symptomatic treatment only. Testing for other infections is not indicated unless the patient worsens or does not improve.
