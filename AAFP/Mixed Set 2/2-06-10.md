Bladder training

This patient suffers from urge urinary incontinence, defined as the loss of urine accompanied or preceded
by a strong impulse to void. It may be accompanied by frequency and nocturia, and is common in older
adults. Conservative therapies such as behavioral therapy, including bladder training and lifestyle
modification, should be the first-line treatment for both stress and urge urinary incontinence (SOR C).
Pharmacologic interventions should be used as an adjunct to behavioral therapies for refractory urge
incontinence (SOR C). Vaginal inserts, such as pessaries, can be used for treating stress incontinence but
not urge incontinence.
