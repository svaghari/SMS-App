Nifedipine (Procardia)

There is no currently approved treatment for Raynaud’s disease. However, patients with this disorder reportedly experience subjective symptomatic improvement with dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, with nifedipine being the calcium channel blocker of choice. (1-Antagonists such as prazosin or terazosin are also effective. p-Blockers can produce arterial insufficiency of the Raynaud type, so propranolol and atenolol are contraindicated. Drugs such as ergotamine preparations can produce cold sensitivity, and should therefore be avoided in patients with Raynaud’s disease. Cilostazol is indicated for intermittent claudication but not for Raynaud’s disease.
