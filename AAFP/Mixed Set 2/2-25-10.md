A topical mild-potency corticosteroid

Topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for atopic dermatitis flare-ups. Topical calcineuron inhibitors such as pimecrolimus are a second-line therapy, but carry a warning of a possible link to lymphomas and skin malignancies and are not recommended for children under 2 years of age. Oral antihistamines are not effective for the pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis. Probiotic use is not supported by available evidence.
