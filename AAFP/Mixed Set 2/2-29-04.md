a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test

The differential diagnosis of multiple small scaling plaques includes drug eruptions, secondary syphilis, guttate psoriasis, and erythema migrans. If the diagnosis cannot be made conclusively by clinical examination, a test for syphilis should be ordered. The rash of secondary syphilis may be indistinguishable from pityriasis rosea on initial examination, particularly when no herald patch is noted. The rashes associated with hyperthyroidism, infectious mononucleosis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and fungal infections are not in the differential diagnosis for this patient.
