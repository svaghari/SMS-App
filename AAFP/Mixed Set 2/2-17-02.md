Nitroglycerin

This patient has classic findings for acute rectal fissure. Although patients often require an internal sphincterotomy, nonsurgical measures that relax the sphincter have proven helpful. Botulinum toxin injected into the internal sphincter has proven most beneficial, but topical preparations are not yet available and have not been shown to be effective for this problem. Corticosteroid creams may decrease the pain temporarily, but potent fluorinated corticosteroid creams such as clobetasol are not indicated in the treatment of fissure. Capsaicin cream can be helpful for pruritus ani, but not for anal fissures. Drugs that dilate the internal sphincter, including diltiazem, nifedipine, and nitroglycerin ointment, have proven to be beneficial in healing acute fissures, but usually have to be compounded by a pharmacist.
