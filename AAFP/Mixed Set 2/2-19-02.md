Ferritin

After confirmation of anemia and microcytosis on a CBC, a serum ferritin level is recommended (SOR C). If the ferritin level is consistent with iron deficiency anemia, identifying the underlying cause of the anemia is the priority. A common cause of iron deficiency anemia in premenopausal adult women is menstrual blood loss. If the serum ferritin level is not consistent with iron deficiency anemia, the next stage of the evaluation should include a serum iron level, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (SOR C). Iron deficiency anemia is still probable if the serum iron level and transferrin saturation are decreased and TIBC is increased. It is more likely anemia of chronic disease if the serum iron level is decreased and the TIBC and transferrin saturation are decreased or normal. Other laboratory tests that may help in differentiating the cause of microcytosis include hemoglobin electrophoresis, a reticulocyte count, and peripheral blood smears.
