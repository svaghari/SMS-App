MRI

Osteomyelitis is a serious complication of diabetic foot infections and is present in up to 20% of mild to moderate infections and in 50%â€“60% of severe infections. While a bone biopsy and/or bone cultures are definitive for making the diagnosis, radiologic studies can also be helpful. Plain radiography may show bony destruction but has a sensitivity for osteomyelitis ranging from 28% to 75%, depending on the timing of the examination and the severity of the infection. It may take weeks for these infections to become apparent on plain radiographs. The sensitivity of triple-phase technetium bone scans is up to 90% but they have low specificity for osteomyelitis. The 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity of MRI is superior to all other imaging modalities.
