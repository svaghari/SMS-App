Losartan (Cozaar)

Patients with diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, and end-organ damage benefit from ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) equally when they are used to prevent progression of diabetic nephropathy. Combining an ACE inhibitor with an ARB is not recommended, as it provides no additional benefit and leads to higher creatinine levels, along with an increased likelihood that dialysis will become necessary.
