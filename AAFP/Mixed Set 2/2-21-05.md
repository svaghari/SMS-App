Amlodipine (Norvasc)

Amlodipine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme. Clarithromycin is a strong 3A4 inhibitor that can slow the metabolism of calcium channel blockers metabolized by this enzyme, thus increasing their levels. This can lead to hypotension, edema, and acute kidney injury due to decreased renal perfusion. It is preferable to choose a different antibiotic regimen for patients on a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine, but if another antibiotic cannot be used, either temporarily stopping the calcium channel blocker or empirically lowering the dosage should be considered.
