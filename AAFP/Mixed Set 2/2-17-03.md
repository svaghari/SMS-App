Adding spironolactone (Aldactone)

Spironolactone is now recommended for treating resistant hypertension, even when hyperaldosteronism is not present. A longer-acting diuretic such as chlorthalidone is also recommended for treating hypertension, particularly in resistant cases with normal renal function. There is no benefit to switching from an ACE inhibitor to an ARB. Nitrates have some effect on blood pressure but are recommended only for patients with coronary artery disease.
