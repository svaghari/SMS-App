Heel pain that is worse with the first steps in the morning

Plantar fasciitis is characterized by pain that is worse with the first few steps in the morning or after a
prolonged rest. NSAIDs may help with the discomfort, but prompt relief of the pain by any modality is not common. The pain is typically in the medial heel. While 50% of people with plantar fasciitis have heel spurs on radiographs, this finding is not causative or diagnostic. The diagnosis is made clinically.
