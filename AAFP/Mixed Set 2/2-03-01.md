MR or CT angiography of the lower extremities

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that 1.4% of adults over 40 have an ankle-brachial index (ABI) >1.4; this group accounts for approximately 20% of all adults with peripheral artery disease. An ABI >1.4 indicates noncompressible arteries (calcified vessels). In patients with arterial calcification, such as diabetic patients, more reliable information is often obtained by using toe pressures to calculate a toe-brachial index and from pulse volume recordings.

Vascular imaging should be used to confirm peripheral vascular disease. MR or CT arteriography, duplex scanning, and hemodynamic localization are noninvasive methods for lesion localization and may be helpful when symptoms or findings do not correlate with the ABI. Contrast arteriography is used for definitive localization before intervention.
