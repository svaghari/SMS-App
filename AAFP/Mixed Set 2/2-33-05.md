Methylergonovine

Uterotonics are the first-line treatment for postpartum hemorrhage in patients with decreased uterine tone. While all of the uterotonic agents listed are options for the management of postpartum hemorrhage, methylergonovine should be avoided if the patient is hypertensive. It is an ergot alkaloid that causes generalized smooth muscle contraction and can raise blood pressure. Oxytocin and misoprostol do not have any contraindications. Carboprost tromethamine should be avoided in asthmatic patients and is relatively contraindicated if the patient has hepatic, renal, or cardiac disease.
