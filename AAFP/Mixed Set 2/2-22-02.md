Increase his dietary fiber intake

Increased intake of dietary fiber and increased exercise have been shown to prevent recurrences of
diverticulitis (SOR B). Weight loss has been shown to be effective in persons with a body mass index of
30 kg/m2 or higher but this patient is underweight and should not be counseled to lose weight (SOR B).
There is no evidence that avoiding nuts, corn, or popcorn decreases the risk of diverticulitis (SOR B). Risk
factors for diverticulitis include the use of NSAIDs, but not acetaminophen.
