Determine the reason each person is present today

Interactions between the physician and patient involve the patient’s family and friends, as well as others who may be part of the patient’s social support system. These interactions, as well as the physician-patient relationship itself, are also strongly influenced by ethnic, cultural, and spiritual values and by beliefs about illness and approaches to treatment and ongoing care. Involvement of family members in a patient’s care is advantageous to good communication and helpful for both accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment (SOR C).
Patient confidentiality should be protected, and the mere presence of other people accompanying the patient does not automatically constitute permission to discuss private health information with them. The physician should determine not only who is present with a patient, but also each person’s reason for being present (SOR C). Speaking to relatives or friends without the patient present may be appropriate under certain circumstances but would not be the best option in this scenario. Constructing a genogram can also be helpful, but that would not be the first priority in this case.
