Placental disease

Stillbirth is defined as fetal death occurring at or after 20 weeks gestation, and affects approximately 1 in 160 pregnancies in the United States. A large study of stillbirths from 2006 to 2008 tried to establish a cause in 663 cases, and a probable or possible cause was identified in approximately 75% of these. While there were some significant ethnic differences, placental abnormalities and obstetric complications were the largest category of causes in white women, and this was even more true after 32 weeks gestation. Other important causes included infection and fetal defects. More than one cause was found in one-third of cases.
