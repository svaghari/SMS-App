Oral griseofulvin

Tinea capitis is an infection of the scalp caused by a variety of superficial dermatophytes. The treatment of choice for this infection is oral griseofulvin. It has the fewest drug interactions, a good safety record, and anti-inflammatory properties. Terbinafine has equal effectiveness and requires a significantly shorter duration of therapy, but it is only available in tablet form. Since tinea capitis most commonly occurs in children, tablets would have to be cut and/or crushed prior to administration. Oral itraconazole, fluconazole, and ketoconazole have significant side effects. Topical antifungals such as ketoconazole and miconazole are ineffective against tinea capitis. Topical acyclovir is used in the treatment of herpesvirus infections, and oral cephalosporins are used in the treatment of bacterial skin infections.
