Reassurance and continued observation

Intoeing, as described in this patient, is usually caused by internal tibial torsion. This problem is believed to be caused by sleeping in the prone position and sitting on the feet. In 90% of cases internal tibial torsion gradually resolves without intervention by the age of 8. Avoiding sleeping in a prone position enhances resolution of the problem. Night splints, orthotics, and shoe wedges are ineffective. Surgery (osteotomy) has been associated with a high complication rate, and is therefore not recommended in mild cases before the age of 8.
