Evaluation for causes of secondary hypertension

The Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents defines hypertension in children as a systolic or diastolic blood pressure above the 95th percentile for the patientâ€™s sex, age, and height on several different readings. Although it is appropriate to have this finding confirmed in the outpatient setting, 130 mm Hg is still at the 99th percentile for systolic blood pressures in this patient. Hypertension in a patient this young should prompt a search for secondary causes, which are more common in young hypertensive patients than in adults with hypertension. The recommended workup includes blood and urine testing, as well as renal ultrasonography. An evaluation for end-organ damage is also recommended, including retinal evaluation and echocardiography.
