Haloperidol

This patient is showing signs of delirium, which is common in hospice patients. Delirium should be considered in anyone with disturbances of cognitive function, altered attention, fluctuating consciousness, or acute agitation. The mainstay of management is the diagnosis and treatment of any conditions that may cause delirium. Medications that may cause delirium should be discontinued or reduced if possible. Antipsychotic medications are the drug of choice to improve delirium. Central nervous system depressants such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates should be avoided because they can make delirium worse. Nortriptyline has anticholinergic side effects and can also cause delirium. Mirtazapine would not be helpful for treating delirium.
