Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia

Patients with repeated EKGs showing a QTc interval >480 ms with a syncopal episode, or >500 ms in the absence of symptoms, are diagnosed with long QT syndrome if no secondary cause such as medication use is present. This syndrome occurs in 1 in 2000 people and consists of cardiac repolarization defects. It is associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, including torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death. It may be treated with p-blockers and implanted cardioverter defibrillators.
