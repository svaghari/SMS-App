Tortuous retinal veins on funduscopic examination

The signs of retinal vein occlusion typically include sudden painless loss of vision or distortion of vision. Redness is not typical and should cause the clinician to suspect an alternate diagnosis. Tortuous and dilated retinal veins are the most common finding on funduscopic examination. Patients also often have multiple cotton-wool spots, although these are not specific to retinal vein occlusion. An afferent pupillary defect often occurs on the affected side. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are both risk factors for retinal vein occlusion, increasing the likelihood in this patient.
