A persistent occiput posterior position is associated with a higher risk of cesarean delivery and assisted vaginal delivery, and a lower chance of spontaneous vaginal delivery. Assisted vaginal deliveries are associated with a higher rate of third-and fourth-degree perineal lacerations and postpartum hemorrhage.
