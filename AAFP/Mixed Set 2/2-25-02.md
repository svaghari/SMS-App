Esophagogastroduodenoscopy

This patient has red flag findings of older age and weight loss with chronic vomiting and is at risk for a gastrointestinal malignancy. He should be referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Abdominal ultrasonography or radiographs would not be necessary at this time. A proton pump inhibitor or H2-blocker can be prescribed but should not delay referral for EGD.
