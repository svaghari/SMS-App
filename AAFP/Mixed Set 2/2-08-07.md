the history and examination

Osgood-Schlatter disease is an inflammatory condition that is a common cause of knee pain in children and adolescents. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical findings, although radiographs may be necessary to rule out fractures or other problems if findings are not typical. MRI, ultrasonography, and orthopedic referral are not usually needed. The problem is typically self-limited and responds to activity modification, over-the-counter analgesics, stretching, and physical therapy.
