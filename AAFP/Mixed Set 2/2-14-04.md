D-dimer

A number of pretest probability scoring systems are available for assessing venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. Although the Wells clinical prediction rule is widely used, other tools such as the Hamilton score and the AMUSE (Amsterdam Maastricht Utrecht Study on thromboEmbolism) score are also available. The Wells rule divides patients suspected of having a DVT into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories, with a 5%, 17%, and 53% prevalence of DVT, respectively. This patient has a Wells score of 0 (+1 for calf circumference increase >3 cm, +1 for pitting edema, â€“2 for a likely alternative diagnosis of gastrocnemius strain) and is therefore at low risk. A negative D-dimer assay has a high negative predictive value for DVT, so the diagnosis can be ruled out in a patient who has a low pretest probability and a negative D-dimer result. A negative D-dimer assay does not rule out DVT in a patient with a moderate to high pretest probability (SOR C).
