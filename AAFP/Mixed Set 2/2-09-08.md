Severe joint pain

The major indication for joint replacement is severe joint pain. Loss of joint function and radiographic evidence of severe destruction of the joint may also be considered in the decision. The appearance of the joint and the status of the contralateral joint may be minor considerations. Surgical insertion of a foreign body into an infected joint is contraindicated.
