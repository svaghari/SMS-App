Modifying her work routines

This patient has signs and symptoms of lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, or alternatively as lateral epicondylalgia to reflect the noninflammatory nature of the condition. This is an overuse tendinopathy of the common extensor tendon origin of the lateral elbow. Conservative care that includes offloading the involved tendons is the key to improving outcomes at 1 year, which would mean modifying this patient’s work. Physical therapy can improve pain and function in the short term, but has not been shown to improve long-term outcomes at 1 year in randomized trials (SOR A). The evidence is weaker for bracing, with some studies showing improved pain and function at 3–6 weeks (SOR B). Recent randomized, controlled trials have made it clear that while corticosteroid injections reduce acute pain for up to 6 weeks, their use increases rates of poor long-term outcomes (SOR A).
