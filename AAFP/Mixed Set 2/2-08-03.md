Neurosurgical consultation for posterior cerebellar hematoma decompression

Aggressive neurosurgical intervention is not indicated to evacuate clots in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage except in those with a cerebellar hemorrhage, which is always an indication for neurosurgical consultation. Guidelines have been developed by the American Heart Association for lowering blood pressure in patients with a systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg, or a mean arterial pressure >130 mm Hg. The use of various forms of osmotherapy, including mannitol, to prevent the development of cerebral edema has not been shown to improve outcomes. The data regarding hypothermia induction is unclear. Patients with an INR >1.5 should receive therapy to replace vitamin Kâ€“dependent factors and have their warfarin withheld.
