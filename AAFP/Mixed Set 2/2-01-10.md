Enteral nutrition

Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition for patients with severe pancreatitis who have been
on prolonged bowel rest, and it is associated with lower complication rates and shorter hospitalizations
(SOR A). Prophylactic antibiotics should only be used when there is significant necrosis (SOR C).
Similarly, surgical debridement is indicated only if there is infected necrosis or persistent fluid collections
(SOR C).
