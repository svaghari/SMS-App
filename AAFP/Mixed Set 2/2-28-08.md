Inhaled fluticasone (Flovent) daily

Patients with mild asthma are often undertreated. Constant inhaled corticosteroids improve both asthma
control and quality of life. Inhaled albuterol is useful as a quick treatment for acute symptoms in patients
with mild asthma. Oral prednisone causes many side effects and is best for chronic use in patients whose
symptoms are not controlled by other means. Cromolyn sodium has a good side-effect profile, but is not
as effective as inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled salmeterol, when used chronically, increases the risk of
asthma-related death.
