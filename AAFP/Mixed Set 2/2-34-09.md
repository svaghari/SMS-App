Buckwheat honey

This patientâ€™s symptoms are most consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection. There is no curative treatment so management should be focused on symptoms. Most over-the-counter cough and cold preparations, including the ingredients dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine, have no evidence of benefit and carry a risk of harm in children and should not be recommended. Albuterol is only helpful for cough in patients with wheezing. Buckwheat honey has limited evidence of effectiveness but appears to carry no risk of harm and may be recommended for symptom management.
