A 60-year-old who quit smoking 10 years ago

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in adults 55–80 years of age who have a 30-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have lung surgery (B recommendation).

The risk of lung cancer increases with age and cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke and decreases with time since quitting smoking. The best evidence comes from the National Lung Screening Trial, which enrolled adults age 55–74 who had at least a 30-pack-year smoking history and were current smokers or had quit in the past 15 years. Screening with LDCT resulted in a 20% reduction in lung-cancer mortality among participants. Stratification of participants according to lung cancer risk showed that screening with LDCT prevented the greatest number of deaths from lung cancer among participants with the highest risk and prevented few deaths in the lowest-risk groups. Smoking cessation remains the most effective way to decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with lung cancer, however.
