Labetalol (Trandate)

The drug most often recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension in pregnancy is labetalol. Reports of an association of metoprolol with fetal growth restriction have given rise to the recommendation to avoid its use in pregnancy. Both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers are contraindicated in pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects and fetal or neonatal renal failure. Immediate-release nifedipine is not recommended due to the risk of hypotension.
