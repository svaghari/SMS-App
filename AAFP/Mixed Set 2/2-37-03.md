Hypertonic saline

This patient has severe hyponatremia manifested by confusion and seizures, a life-threatening situation warranting urgent treatment with hypertonic (3%) saline. The serum sodium level should be raised by only 1–2 mEq/dL per hour, to prevent serious neurologic complications. Saline should be used only until the seizures stop. Some authorities recommend concomitant use of furosemide, especially in patients who are likely to be volume overloaded, as this patient is, but it should not be used alone. The arginine vasopressin antagonist conivaptan is approved for the treatment of euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia, but not in patients who are obtunded or in a coma, or who are having seizures.
