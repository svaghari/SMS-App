Ocular corticosteroids

Uveitis is inflammation of the uveal tract and can affect any or all of its components, including the iris. It is the most common extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), seen in up to 60% of patients with AS. Iritis presents with a painful red eye with conjunctival injection, photophobia, and a sluggishly reacting pupil. A hazy-appearing anterior chamber results from the iris producing an inflammatory exudate. Treatment includes topical corticosteroids, but oral or parenteral corticosteroids and NSAIDs are also effective. Reduced anterior spine flexion (a positive modified Schober test) results from the skeletal manifestations of AS. A “bamboo spine” is classically seen on lumbar radiographs. Oral or ocular antibiotics, artificial tears, ophthalmic olopatadine, and oral acetazolamide are ineffective. Ophthalmology referral is recommended (SOR B).
