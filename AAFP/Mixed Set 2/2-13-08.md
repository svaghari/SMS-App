Grapefruit

Ingestion of grapefruit juice can increase absorption and serum levels of statins, leading to an increased risk of muscle injury. The mechanism for this is believed to be the cytochrome p-450 pathway. Starfruit juice and pomegranate juice can have a similar effect. These juices contain an irreversible inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4, and increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin. Rosuvastatin and fluvastatin utilize the CYP2C9 system for metabolism, so the effect on these drugs is minimal.

Grapefruit juice reduces CYP3A4 activity by 50% within 4 hours of ingestion, and activity is reduced by 30% for as long as 24 hours after ingestion. Several studies document that consuming 600 mL of double-strength juice for 3 days produces a more than tenfold increase in the area under the curve for simvastatin and lovastatin, but only a 250% increase in atorvastatin.
