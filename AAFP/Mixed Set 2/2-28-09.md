Crush injury wounds

Medical hyperbaric oxygen is considered a reimbursable treatment option by many insurers for a long list of diagnoses. The list of conditions shown to benefit from hyperbaric oxygen is a much shorter one, however, and includes decompression sickness and wounds caused by crush injuries. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment has been shown to improve diabetic foot ulcers in the short term but studies have so far failed to prove long-term benefit.
