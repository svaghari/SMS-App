Acute stress disorder

Acute stress disorder (ASD) lies on a spectrum of trauma-related disorders between adjustment disorder
and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). ASD is differentiated from PTSD primarily by duration, with
PTSD requiring the presence of similar symptoms (intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and
arousal) for longer than 1 month. Conversely, adjustment disorder is a less severe condition than ASD that
involves either a less traumatic or threatening inciting event and/or less severe symptoms that do not meet
DSM-5 criteria for acute stress disorder.
