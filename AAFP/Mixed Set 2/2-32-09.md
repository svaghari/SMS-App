The time course of symptom onset

This patient presents with marked hyperglycemia but no evidence of ketoacidosis or nonketotic coma. Differentiating between type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus is important for guiding therapy. The gradual onset of symptoms is more consistent with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas type 1 diabetes typically has a more rapid onset. Patients with type 1 diabetes typically need lower doses of insulin to correct hyperglycemia, as they lack the insulin insensitivity that is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes. Positive anti-GAD antibodies and low C-peptide at the time of the initial diagnosis are also consistent with type 1 diabetes, although C-peptide levels can also be low in long-standing type 2 diabetes. Weight loss occurs in both types of diabetes mellitus when glucose is profoundly elevated.
