Oral dexamethasone

This patient presents with a typical case of mild to moderate croup. This is a viral infection that results in swelling in the larynx. It rarely is severe enough to cause respiratory collapse or require intubation and must be differentiated from more severe conditions such as epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, or pneumonia. There is no reason to treat this viral infection with an antibiotic. The condition is usually benign and self-limiting, with the worst symptoms occurring at night. Cool and/or humidified air has traditionally been recommended, but studies have not confirmed any significant benefit from these interventions. Since this child is not in respiratory distress and oxygenation is normal, supplemental oxygen therapy is not indicated. Studies have confirmed the benefits of treating croup with a single dose of either an oral or intramuscular corticosteroid. Specifically, dexamethasone is recommended due to its 72-hour length of effect. Inhaled racemic epinephrine has been shown to reduce the need for intubation in cases of moderate to severe croup. Albuterol, however, is not indicated.
