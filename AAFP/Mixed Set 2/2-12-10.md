Oral vancomycin (Vancocin)

Vancomycin, 125 mg orally 4 times daily for 10–14 days, is recommended for the first severe episode of
Clostridium difficile colitis (SOR B). If the first episode is mild to moderate, oral metronidazole, 500 mg
3 times daily for 10–14 days, would be preferred. Intravenous vancomycin is not effective in the treatment
of colitis. Rifaximin is not well studied and is not recommended in any current guidelines.
