No diagnostic imaging

The diagnosis of plantar fasciitis is based primarily on the history and physical examination. Patients may present with heel pain, and palpation of the medial plantar calcaneal region may elicit a sharp pain. Discomfort in the proximal plantar fascia can be elicited by passive ankle/first toe dorsiflexion. Diagnostic imaging is rarely needed for the initial diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. In recalcitrant plantar fasciitis plain films may be helpful for detecting bony lesions of the foot. Ultrasonography is inexpensive and may be useful for ruling out soft-tissue pathology of the heel in some patients. While MRI is expensive, it is a valuable tool for assessing causes of recalcitrant heel pain.
