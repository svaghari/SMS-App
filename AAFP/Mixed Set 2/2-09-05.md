Cooking

Basic activities of daily living, such as dressing, eating, toileting, and grooming, are generally intact in early dementia. In contrast, instrumental activities of daily living, such as managing money and medications, shopping, cooking, housekeeping, and transportation, which often require calculation or planning, are frequently impaired in early dementia.
