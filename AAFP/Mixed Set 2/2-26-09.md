Chronic pulmonary thromboembolism

A diffusion capacity test assesses how well a tracer gas in inspired air can cross from the air into the blood. The diffusion capacity provides a general assessment of the air-blood interface. Reduced values are seen with severe interstitial fibrosis, or when the capillary surface has been compromised by vascular obstruction (pulmonary embolism) or is destroyed by emphysema. Chronic pulmonary embolism causes a low diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) with normal pulmonary function tests. Emphysema causes a low DLCO and an obstructive pattern on pulmonary function testing (PFT). Interstitial lung disease and hypersensitivity pneumonitis both cause a low DLCO with a restrictive pattern of PFTs. Patients with asthma may have an increased DLCO with an obstructive pattern, with reversibility after bronchodilator administration.
