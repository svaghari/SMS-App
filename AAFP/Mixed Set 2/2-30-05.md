MRI of the pituitary

Prolactin levels can be elevated because of a pituitary adenoma, medication side effects, hypothyroidism, or a mass lesion compromising normal hypothalamic inhibition. Elevated prolactin levels inhibit the secretion and effect of gonadotropins. In almost all patients with an elevated prolactin level, MRI of the pituitary is recommended to exclude the possibility of a pituitary adenoma (SOR C). This patient is not on any medications, essentially ruling out a pharmacologic trigger for her elevated prolactin.
