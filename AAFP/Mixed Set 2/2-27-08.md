Acute mesenteric ischemia

Mesenteric ischemia presents with pain disproportionate to the findings on examination, often with nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Air within the wall of dilated loops of small bowel (pneumatosis intestinalis) and evidence of acidosis also suggest bowel ischemia. Cholangitis most likely would be associated with a more substantial elevation of the amylase and/or lipase levels, as well as elevated bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase levels. Pancreatitis would also be associated with higher amylase and/or lipase levels.

Acute appendicitis often has a vague presentation in older patients, presenting without fever and not localizing to the right lower quadrant as it does in younger patients. However, the leukocytosis is usually not as dramatic as in this case, there is usually no elevation of the amylase or lipase levels, and imaging does not show air within the small bowel.
