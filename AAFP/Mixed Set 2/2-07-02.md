Methylphenidate (Ritalin)

There is good evidence that psychostimulants reduce symptoms of depression within days, making methylphenidate a good choice for this patient (SOR B). Electroconvulsive therapy is contraindicated due to her brain lesions. Mirtazapine, fluoxetine, and nortriptyline all take at least 3–4 weeks to have any antidepressant effects, and would not be appropriate given the patient’s life expectancy (SOR B).
