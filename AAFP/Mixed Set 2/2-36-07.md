Hydrochlorothiazide

Thiazide diuretics have proven efficacy in the treatment of hypertension in all age groups and sexes. When used as antihypertensive agents, the reduction in adverse cardiovascular outcomes equals that of a-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors. Successful thiazide treatment of hypertension is especially effective in preventing heart failure or strokes. Unlike the other options listed, thiazide diuretics have also been shown to slow cortical bone loss in postmenopausal females and to reduce the incidence of osteoporosis and hip fractures in those who take it continuously. This protective beneficial side effect disappears within 4 months following discontinuation of thiazide therapy. As with all medications there are potential disadvantages of thiazide use, including excessive urinary losses of potassium and sodium and possible increases in serum glucose levels.
