Elliptical excision of the thrombosed hemorrhoid

The appropriate management of a thrombosed hemorrhoid presenting within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms is elliptical excision of the hemorrhoid and overlying skin under local anesthesia, such as 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride in 1:200,000 epinephrine, infiltrated slowly with a 27-gauge needle.

Incision and clot removal may provide inadequate drainage, resulting in rehemorrhage and clot reaccumulation. Most thrombosed hemorrhoids contain multilocular clots that may not be accessible through a simple incision. Rubber band ligation is an excellent technique for management of internal hemorrhoids, and infrared coagulation is also used for this purpose. Banding an external hemorrhoid would cause exquisite pain.

If the pain is already subsiding or more time has elapsed, and if there is no necrosis or ulceration, measures such as sitz baths, bulk laxatives, stool softeners, and local analgesia may be helpful. Some local anesthetics carry the risk of sensitization. Counseling to avoid precipitating factors such as prolonged standing/sitting, constipation, and delay of defecation is also appropriate.
