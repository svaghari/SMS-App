Case management by a heart failure specialist nurse

Many elderly patients with heart failure are hospitalized repeatedly at short intervals. As described in a 2012 Cochrane review of 25 randomized, controlled trials, there is now good evidence that case management interventions led by a heart failure specialist nurse reduce heart failure readmissions, all-cause readmissions, and all-cause mortality. Case management interventions include home care, telephone calls, patient education, self-management, and face-to-face visits. It is not possible to say which specific interventions were optimal, but telephone follow-up was a common component in most of these trials. Multidisciplinary interventions may also be effective. For patients treated with lisinopril, 40 mg/day is the maximum amount recommended for heart failure. While $-adrenergic blockers and aldosterone antagonists are used in the treatment of heart failure, prophylactic amiodarone would not be expected to help and may be harmful. Admission to a nursing home may reduce hospitalization, but it would also increase overall costs of care.
