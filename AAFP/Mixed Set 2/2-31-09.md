Pneumocystis

Patients with HIV infection and severe immunodeficiency are at risk for certain opportunistic infections. Susceptibility to opportunistic infections can be measured by CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. Patients with a CD4+ count <200 cells/mm3 should receive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia, and prophylaxis against Toxoplasma gondii should also be given if the CD4+ level is <100 cells/mm3. Azithromycin is used to prevent infection with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex when CD4+ counts are <50 cells/mm3. Itraconazole is used to prevent Histoplasma capsulatum infection when the CD4+ count is :150 cells/mm3 if the patient is at risk due to occupational exposure or living in a community with a hyperendemic rate of histoplasmosis (>10 cases per 100 patient years). There is no recommendation for prophylaxis against microsporidiosis.
