Calcitonin-salmon (Miacalcin)

A number of measures for managing spinal compression fractures have been evaluated. The evidence for recommending kyphoplasty is weak, and the evidence for recommending against vertebroplasty is strong. The data on bracing is inconclusive, as is the recommendation for bed rest. Calcitonin has been shown to reduce the incidence of recurrent fractures and may be useful in the relief of pain.
