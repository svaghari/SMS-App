A ring pessary

Pessaries are considered first-line treatment for pelvic organ prolapse (SOR C). Ring pessaries provide support and are the initial choice in most circumstances. Sexual intercourse can still occur with a ring pessary, which can be inserted and removed by the patient. Space-occupying pessaries are associated with more vaginal discharge and irritation and do not allow for sexual intercourse. While they can improve stress and urge urinary incontinence, Kegel exercises do not treat pelvic organ prolapse. Surgery, including hysterectomy or hysteropexy that conserves the uterus, can be considered after first-line treatment with a pessary.
