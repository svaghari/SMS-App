hepatitis A vaccine only

Workers and children at child care centers should receive postexposure prophylaxis if one or more cases of hepatitis A is found in a child or worker. Hepatitis A vaccine is preferred over immunoglobulin because of its long-lasting effect, ease of administration, and efficacy. Children younger than 1 year of age should receive immunoglobulin. Family members should receive prophylaxis only during an outbreak and if their child is still in diapers.
