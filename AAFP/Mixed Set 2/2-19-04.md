Spironolactone (Aldactone)

Except for persistent pubertal gynecomastia, medication use and substance use are the most common causes of nonphysiologic gynecomastia. Common medication-related causes include the use of antipsychotic agents, antiretroviral drugs, or prostate cancer therapies. Spironolactone also has a high propensity to cause gynecomastia; other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as eplerenone, have not been associated with similar effects. Discontinuing the contributing agent often results in regression of breast tissue within 3 months.
