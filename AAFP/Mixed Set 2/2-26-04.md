Atypical femoral shaft fractures

The use of bisphosphonates is associated with a small increase in the risk of atypical femoral shaft
fractures. The risk increases with the duration of use (SOR B). These drugs are also associated with an
increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw, esophagitis, and esophageal ulceration, as well as hypocalcemia.
In fact, bisphosphonates are used as a treatment for hypercalcemia. They do not affect phosphorus or
vitamin D levels.
