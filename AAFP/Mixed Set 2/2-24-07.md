Starting mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes

In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), starting mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg is superior to starting with traditional tidal volumes of 10â€“14 mL/kg (SOR A). Conservative fluid therapy is recommended in patients with ARDS, as this is associated with a decrease in the number of days on the ventilator and in the intensive-care unit (SOR B). Pulmonary artery catheters are not recommended for routine management of ARDS (SOR A). Surfactant therapy does not improve mortality in adults with ARDS (SOR A), and antibiotics are not an effective treatment.
