Increases in blood pressure

Stimulants are preferred over nonstimulant medications for adults with attention-deficit disorder. Stimulant medications can aggravate psychosis, tics, or hypertension and are therefore contraindicated in patients with these problems. The main side effects of these drugs include insomnia, dry mouth, weight loss, headaches, and anxiety. They are classified as schedule II drugs due to their potential for abuse. The risk for serious adverse cardiovascular events is very low, although these drugs can increase resting heart rate and elevate both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
