Fluticasone nasal spray (Flonase)

The initial treatment of mild to moderate allergic rhinitis should be an intranasal corticosteroid alone, with the use of second-line therapies for moderate to severe disease (SOR A). The adverse effects and higher cost of intranasal antihistamines, as well as their decreased effectiveness compared with intranasal corticosteroids, limit their use as first-or second-line therapy for allergic rhinitis. Moderate to severe disease not responsive to intranasal corticosteroids should be treated with second-line therapies, including antihistamines, decongestants, cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and nonpharmacologic therapies such as nasal irrigation.
