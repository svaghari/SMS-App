Epiglottitis

Many infections of the respiratory tract have a viral etiology, and when this is the case early antibiotic treatment offers little to no benefit. Once the clinical course of a respiratory illness exceeds the expected length for a viral illness, it may be proper to initiate antibiotic treatment for a suspected atypical or secondary bacterial infection. Epiglottitis is one exception to this approach because of the possibility of a bacterial infection, particularly with Haemophilus influenzae type b, that can produce a rapidly worsening, potentially fatal airway compromise. When epiglottitis is suspected based on findings such as hoarseness, dysphagia, stridor, drooling, fever, chills, and respiratory distress, intravenous antibiotic treatment should be instituted immediately, ideally with a $-lactam drug that exhibits activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
