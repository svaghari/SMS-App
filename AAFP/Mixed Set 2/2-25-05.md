Low radioactive iodine uptake (<5%)

Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is the most common cause of thyroid pain. Free T4 is elevated early in the disease, as it is in Graves disease; however, later in the disease T4 becomes depressed and then returns to normal as the disease resolves. Pretibial myxedema, exophthalmos, and a thyroid thrill or bruit can all be found in Graves disease, but are not associated with subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. Multiple nodules on ultrasonography suggests multinodular goiter rather than subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. Patients with subacute granulomatous thyroiditis will have a low radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) at 24 hours, but patients with Graves disease will have an elevated RAIU (SOR C).
