A high-sensitivity D-dimer test

This patient has a low pretest probability of pulmonary embolism based on the Wells criteria. She would be a good candidate for a high-sensitivity D-dimer test, with a negative test indicating a low probability of venous thromboembolism. In patients with a low pretest probability of venous thromboembolism, ultrasonography or helical CT would not be the recommended initial evaluation. Neither troponin I nor an ANA level would be part of the recommended initial evaluation.
