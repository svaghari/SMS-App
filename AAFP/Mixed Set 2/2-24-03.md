Inguinal hernia

This patient’s history, along with the bulge/impulse detected on physical examination when he strained or coughed, is most consistent with the diagnosis of inguinal hernia. A “sports hernia” is not a true hernia, but rather a tearing of tissue fibers. The patient often presents with symptoms consistent with a hernia, but without evidence on physical examination. Pain along the symphysis pubis would suggest osteitis pubis, and pain along the adductor tendons would suggest adductor tendinopathy. Ilioinguinal nerve entrapment syndrome is an abdominal muscular pain syndrome characterized by the clinical triad of muscle-type iliac fossa pain with a characteristic radiation pattern, altered sensory perception in the ilioinguinal nerve cutaneous innervation area, and a well-circumscribed trigger point medial to and below the anterosuperior iliac spine.
