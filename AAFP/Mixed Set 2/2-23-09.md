Use of denosumab rather than bisphosphonates in patients with class III or IV renal dysfunction

The use of medications for osteoporosis is associated with various side effects, some of which have only recently been recognized. Denosumab and bisphosphonates have similar, albeit low, risks for jaw osteonecrosis. Bisphosphonates should not be used in patients with a creatinine clearance <35 mL/min/1.73 m2, but denosumab is not cleared by the kidneys and is safe in patients with chronic kidney disease. The use of bisphosphonates for more than 5 years can increase the risk of atypical fractures and a holiday from the drug is recommended after either 3 or 5 years, depending on the drug used.
