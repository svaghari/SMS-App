Naproxen

Although patients with chronic mild liver disease may take NSAIDs, they should be avoided in all patients with cirrhosis, due to the risk of precipitating hepatorenal syndrome. Pregabalin and gabapentin are not metabolized by the liver and can be quite helpful. Acetaminophen, while toxic in high doses, can be used safely in dosages of 2â€“3 g/day. Tramadol is also safe in patients with cirrhosis.
