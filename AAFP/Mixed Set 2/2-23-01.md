A nasopharyngeal culture and polymerase chain reaction testing

Whooping cough has reemerged over the past few years. The initial catarrhal stage is manifested by nonspecific symptoms similar to those of a viral upper respiratory illness. This stage is usually 1â€“2 weeks in duration, and the patient is highly contagious. The paroxysmal stage is manifested by severe coughing spells that occur in paroxysms and may be followed by the inspiratory whoop (much more likely in children). Post-tussive emesis is another classic sign. There are no characteristic findings on examination other than signs induced by extreme coughing. The CDC recommends both a nasopharyngeal culture and polymerase chain reaction testing to confirm the diagnosis. Serologic testing is useful only in research settings, and direct fluorescent antibody testing is not recommended. Azithromycin should be used as initial therapy, but this is to decrease transmission of the illness and does not improve symptoms.
