Colchicine (Colcrys)

This patient has a classic presentation of podagra (acute metatarsophalangeal joint gout). Without an overlying skin lesion as an indicator of infection, this patient can be assumed to have gout in this classic presentation. Low-dose colchicine, 1.2 mg initially, followed by 0.6 mg in 1 hour, is recommended over high-dose colchicine, 1.2 mg initially, followed by 0.6 mg hourly for 6 hours. The high-dose regimen increases side effects but the effectiveness is not improved. This case should not be assumed to represent a septic joint and treated with cephalexin, given the typical podagra presentation. Febuxostat and allopurinol are urate-lowering drugs used as treatment for intercritical gout and not for acute treatment. Generally, treatment with urate-lowering therapy is not necessary in patients having fewer than two attacks per year.
