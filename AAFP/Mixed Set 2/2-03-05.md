Decreased maximal heart rate with exercise

Maximal heart rate with exercise generally decreases with age. A frequently used formula for predicting maximal heart rate is 220 minus age, with a correction factor of 0.85 often applied for females, who have a lower peak heart rate and a more gradual decline.

Myocardial collagen and mass both increase with age. The increase in collagen may play a role in decreasing left ventricular compliance. The resting heart rate, like the maximal exercising heart rate, decreases with normal aging. Tachycardia at rest may suggest a pathologic state.
