Adding rapid-acting insulin at dinner

This patient continues to have an elevated hemoglobin A1c and bedtime hyperglycemia. The addition of a rapid-acting insulin at dinner would be the next step in management. For patients exhibiting blood glucose elevations before dinner, the addition of rapid-acting insulin at lunch is preferred. For patients with elevations before lunch, rapid-acting insulin with breakfast would most likely improve glucose control. Increasing or splitting the insulin glargine would be unlikely to improve management.
