Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin), 90 mg/kg/day for 10 days

Although high-dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/day) is recommended as the antibiotic of choice for acute otitis media (AOM) in the nonallergic patient, amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended if a child has received antibiotic therapy in the previous 30 days. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended, as harms outweigh benefits. Tympanostomy tubes are an option if a child has had three episodes of AOM in the past 6 months or four episodes in the past year with at least one episode in the past 6 months.
