Verapamil (Calan)

ACE inhibitors and Î²-blockers improve mortality in heart failure (HF). Digoxin and furosemide improve symptoms and reduce hospitalizations in systolic HF, and furosemide may decrease mortality. Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, reduces all-cause mortality and improves ejection fractions in systolic HF. Verapamil, due to its negative inotropic effect, is associated with worsening heart failure and an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.
