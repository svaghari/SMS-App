Alcoholic liver disease

In a study of 256 asymptomatic Swedish patients with mildly elevated liver transaminase levels, alcohol was found to be the cause in 10% of cases. An accurate history is important for making the diagnosis. A biopsy alone cannot differentiate alcoholic liver disease from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. An AST/ALT ratio >2 supports a diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease. Elevated (-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) is also associated with alcohol abuse, especially in a patient with an AST/ALT ratio >2.
