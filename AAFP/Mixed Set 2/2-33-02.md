without the condition who test negative

A screening test’s specificity is the proportion of persons without the condition who test negative for that
condition. In other words, it is a measure of the test’s ability to properly identify those who do not have
the disease. Conversely, the sensitivity of a screening test is the proportion of those with the condition who
test positive. The other options listed describe false-negatives, false-positives, and prevalence.
