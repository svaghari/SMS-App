Divalproex (Depakote)

This patient has bipolar II disorder. She has a history of hypomanic episodes as well as major depression, with no history of a manic or mixed episode. Among the pharmacologic options listed, only divalproex and lithium are indicated for treating bipolar depression or acute mania, and for maintenance. They should be given as single agents, however, not in combination with other drugs. No evidence supports combination therapy or the addition of an antidepressant in the acute phase of depression.

In a study of patients with bipolar II disorder, initially adding paroxetine or bupropion to the mood stabilizer was no more effective than using lithium or valproate. An SSRI or bupropion can be added if a therapeutic dosage of a mood stabilizer does not resolve symptoms and the patient is not in a mixed state. Tricyclic antidepressants and antidepressants with dual properties, such as venlafaxine, should be avoided because they may induce mania. Aripiprazole is indicated for acute mania but not for bipolar depression.
