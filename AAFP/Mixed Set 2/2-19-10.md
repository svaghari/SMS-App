Switch to oral prednisone for 4 more days of treatment

Systemic corticosteroid therapy reduces the hospital length of stay in patients with acute COPD exacerbations (SOR A). Oral therapy has been shown to be as effective as the intravenous route in patients who can tolerate oral intake (SOR B). A randomized, controlled trial has demonstrated that 5-day courses of systemic corticosteroid therapy are at least as effective as 14-day courses (SOR A). Inhaled corticosteroids are beneficial in some COPD patients but nebulizers generally do not offer significant advantages over metered-dose inhalers in most patients.
