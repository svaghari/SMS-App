An upper gastrointestinal series

In young children with bilious emesis, anorexia, and lack of fever, the most likely diagnosis is intestinal malrotation with volvulus. Abdominal ultrasonography is less sensitive and specific for malrotation than an upper gastrointestinal series, so an upper GI series should be ordered initially if volvulus is suspected. If appendicitis were suspected, ultrasonography would be preferred. CT is not a good choice because of the amount of radiation it delivers, especially given efforts to decrease the use of CT in children unless absolutely necessary. This patientâ€™s presentation is not typical for testicular torsion, therefore scrotal ultrasonography should not be the initial test of choice.
