Weight loss

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is characterized by the accumulation of fat in hepatocytes. It is associated with insulin resistance, central adiposity, increased BMI, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. An incidentally discovered elevated AST level in the absence of alcohol or drug-induced liver disease strongly suggests the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The goal of therapy is to prevent or reverse hepatic injury and fibrosis. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other comorbid conditions should be appropriately managed.

A healthy diet, weight loss, and exercise are first-line therapeutic measures to reduce insulin resistance in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Weight loss has been shown to both normalize AST levels and improve hepatic histology. Vitamin E has been shown to improve AST levels but has no impact on liver histology, and pentoxifylline, simvastatin, and L-carnitine have not been shown to consistently improve either AST levels or liver histology (SOR B).
