maximize treatment for heart failure

This patient has pulmonary hypertension due to left heart failure. The recommended treatment is to maximize treatment for her heart failure and any other comorbidities. Vasodilators are not recommended in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension due to left heart failure and may be harmful (SOR C). Oxygen therapy is recommended only for patients with hypoxia (SOR C). Lifelong anticoagulation is recommended if pulmonary hypertension is due to chronic thromboembolic disease but not if it is due to left heart failure (SOR C). Anticoagulation is not recommended in systolic left heart failure unless there is another indication.

Right heart catheterization is not recommended for pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease because vasodilators are not a treatment option. Right heart catheterization is recommended in pulmonary hypertension prior to initiating vasodilator therapy in appropriate patients (SOR C).
