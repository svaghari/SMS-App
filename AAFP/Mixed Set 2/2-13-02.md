Corticosteroids

Emollients are a mainstay of chronic therapy for atopic dermatitis (SOR C), but topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for flare-ups (SOR A). Calcineurin inhibitors such as pimecrolimus are a second-line treatment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (SOR A). Antibiotics are not useful in reducing flare-ups of atopic dermatitis unless there is clear evidence of a secondary infection (SOR A). Neither topical nor oral antihistamines are recommended for routine treatment of atopic dermatitis because they are not effective in treating the associated pruritus.
