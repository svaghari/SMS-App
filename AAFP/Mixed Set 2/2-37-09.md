Echocardiography

Echocardiography is the best study for detecting right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and also allows for estimation of pulmonary artery pressure. Abnormal findings on the physical examination or EKG may be the earliest indicators of RV dysfunction, but these may also appear normal. CT will show RV enlargement, which is predictive of 30-and 90-day mortality, although it is not as quantitative as the EKG (SOR A).
