Carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet)

All of the drugs listed are used to treat motor symptoms in patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. However, the best evidence supports the use of carbidopa/levodopa, non-ergot dopamine agonists such as pramipexole or ropinirole, or monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors such as selegiline or rasagiline for initial management of patients with early disease (SOR A).
