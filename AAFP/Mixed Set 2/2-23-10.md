A urinalysis and urine culture

The most common causes of serious bacterial infection in children 3–36 months of age are pneumonia and urinary tract infection. In children without an obvious source of infection, the urinalysis and culture are key tests in the evaluation. A valid urine sample should be obtained in all children under the age of 2 with a fever of unknown source. The sample should be obtained through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration. If the patient is toilet trained a clean-catch urine sample is acceptable (SOR C). C-reactive protein is currently under investigation for its utility in detecting serious infection in young children. It is thought to have a greater predictive value than WBC counts but is not yet standardized for common use. A CBC with differential is most useful in neonates but is not as helpful in older infants for detecting serious infection. It is recommended for hospitalized patients but not for those managed as outpatients (SOR C).

A chest radiograph is indicated for children with an abnormal respiratory examination or respiratory symptoms. It is also recommended for children older than 1 month of age with a fever >39°C (102°F) and a WBC count >20,000/mm3. A lumbar puncture is indicated for infants with meningeal signs such as focal neurologic findings, petechiae, or nuchal rigidity.
