arginine vasopressin

This patient has diabetes insipidus, which is caused by a deficiency in the secretion or renal action of arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP, also known as antidiuretic hormone, is produced in the posterior pituitary gland and the route of secretion is generally regulated by the osmolality of body fluid stores, including intravascular volume. Its chief action is the concentration of urine in the distal tubules of the kidney. Both low secretion of AVP from the pituitary and reduced antidiuretic action on the kidney can be primary or secondary, and the causes are numerous.

Patients with diabetes insipidus present with profound urinary volume, increased frequency of urination, and thirst. The urine is very dilute, with an osmolality <300 mOsm/L. Further workup will help determine the specific type of diabetes insipidus and its cause, which is necessary for appropriate treatment.

Low levels of aldosterone, plasma renin activity, or angiotensin would cause abnormal blood pressure, electrolyte levels, and/or renal function. Insulin deficiency results in diabetes mellitus.
