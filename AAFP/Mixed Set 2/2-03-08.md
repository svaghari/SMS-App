Calcitonin-salmon (Miacalcin)

While all of the medications listed can be used to treat osteoporosis, only calcitonin-salmon is useful in the management of pain associated with acute or chronic vertebral fractures. Calcitonin is an antiresorptive agent that has been shown to decrease the risk of vertebral fractures, but it is not considered a first-line treatment for osteoporosis because there are more effective agents. However, it does have modest analgesic properties that make it useful in the treatment of the pain associated with vertebral fractures.
