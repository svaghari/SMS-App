Corticosteroid therapy

This patient has Bell’s palsy. Only corticosteroids have been shown to improve the outcome. Antiviral agents have little value in the treatment of Bell’s palsy. Thrombolytic therapy may be useful for a patient with central facial nerve weakness if it is due to a vascular event (level of evidence 3; SOR A).
