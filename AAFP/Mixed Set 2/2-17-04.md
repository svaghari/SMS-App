Fever

Chronic excessive alcohol intake produces functional changes in neurotransmitter activity that can lead to a net increase in excitatory neuroreceptor activity when the person stops drinking. Withdrawal can be divided into four levels of severity: minor, major, seizures, and delirium tremens. Minor alcohol withdrawal is characterized by tremor, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, and/or insomnia 6–24 hours after the patient’s last drink. Major withdrawal occurs 10–72 hours after the last drink and can include the signs and symptoms of minor withdrawal, as well as visual and auditory hallucinations, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure. Alcoholic seizure generally occurs within 2 days of the last drink and may be the only sign of withdrawal, although approximately one-third of these patients will progress to delirium tremens. The onset of delirium tremens can occur anytime within 3–10 days following the last drink. The defining clinical finding is delirium, but the findings seen in milder forms of alcohol withdrawal can also be present, and may be more severe. Fever is most often seen with delirium tremens and is less common with less severe forms of alcohol withdrawal.
