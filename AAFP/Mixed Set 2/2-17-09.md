Local corticosteoid injection

This patient has carpal tunnel syndrome. Initial conservative approaches for mild to moderate symptom
relief include full-time splinting for 8 weeks (SOR B) and oral corticosteroids. However, studies suggest
that local corticosteroid injections offer symptom relief for 1 month longer than oral corticosteroid therapy
and some individuals experience relief for up to 1 year. Severe or chronic symptoms usually require
surgical intervention for nerve decompression. Physical therapy is not recommended, and full rest is
unlikely in a person in a high-risk occupation for overuse syndromes.
