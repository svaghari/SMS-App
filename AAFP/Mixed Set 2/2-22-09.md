Urgent orthopedic referral for possible fasciotomy

This patient most likely has acute compartment syndrome and must be urgently evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon. Typically, compartment pressure can be measured using a needle attached to a manometer, and if the pressure is elevated (usually >40 mm Hg) urgent fasciotomy is necessary to prevent muscle necrosis. If the classic “Five Ps” (pain, paresthesia, pallor, pulselessness, and paralysis) are all present, the outcome will most certainly be bad, even limb-threatening. Early identification with a high index of suspicion and urgent referral for fasciotomy is necessary to prevent tragic results.

Before the classic findings develop, patients will have tenderness out of proportion to the physical appearance of the injury and, most importantly, severe pain in the involved compartment with passive stretching of the involved muscles.

While rest, immobilization, non–weight bearing, and analgesia are all appropriate measures, none of these is sufficient treatment for this urgent problem.
