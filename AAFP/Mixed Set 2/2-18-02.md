Doxycycline

The only FDA-approved oral treatment for acne rosacea is doxycycline at a subantimicrobial dosage (40 mg daily). This does not contribute to antibiotic resistance, even when used over several months, and is better tolerated than higher dosages. Other antibiotics have limited and low-quality supporting evidence of efficacy and may lead to antibiotic resistance.
