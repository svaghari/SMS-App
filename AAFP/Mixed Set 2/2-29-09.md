the patient is transferred out of the critical care unit

Not all hospitalized patients need stress ulcer prophylaxis. Routine acid-suppression therapy to prevent stress ulcers has no benefit in hospitalized patients outside of the critical care setting. Only critically ill patients who meet specific criteria should receive this therapy. One indication for stress ulcer prophylaxis is prolonged mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Hemodynamically stable patients admitted to general care floors should not receive stress ulcer prophylaxis, as it only decreases the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding from 0.33% to 0.22%. Furthermore, long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy has been associated with complications such as Clostridium difficile diarrhea and community-acquired pneumonia. Discontinuation of stress ulcer prophylaxis should be considered for this patient when she moves out of the critical care unit. It could also be considered when the patient is removed from the ventilator.
