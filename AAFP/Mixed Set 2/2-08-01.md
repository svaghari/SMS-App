Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Gastroesophageal reflux disease is one of the most common causes of chronic cough. Patients with “silent” gastroesophageal reflux may not have the classic symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation. The diagnosis is based on resolution of the cough with an empiric trial of a proton pump inhibitor, although a chest radiograph should be obtained in all patients with a chronic cough to exclude bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis. Asthma is another frequent cause of chronic cough, but it can be ruled out with normal pulmonary function tests.
