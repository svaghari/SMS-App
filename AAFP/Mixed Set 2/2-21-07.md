Expectant/conservative management

Lateral epicondylitis is a common condition characterized by degeneration of the extensor carpi radialis muscle tendon originating in the lateral epicondyle. It is a self-limited condition and usually resolves within 12–18 months without treatment. It is not an inflammatory condition and anti-inflammatory agents have not been found to be beneficial. Corticosteroid injections have been found to be associated with poor long-term outcomes, as well as high recurrence rates. Neither physical therapy, bracing, nor splinting is proven to provide long-term pain relief. Approximately 90%–95% of all patients with lateral epicondylitis show improvement at 1 year despite the type of therapy utilized (SOR A).
