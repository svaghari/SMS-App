Coronary artery bypass graft surgery

The Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease (FREEDOM) trial funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute concluded that in patients with diabetes mellitus and advanced coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft surgery was superior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in that it significantly reduced rates of death and myocardial infarction, although stroke rates were higher in the 30-day perioperative period. The FREEDOM trial suggested that these outcomes are similar whether PCI is performed without stents, with bare-metal stents, or with drug-eluting stents. These results were consistent with reports from other smaller or retrospective studies of revascularization in patients with diabetes mellitus.
