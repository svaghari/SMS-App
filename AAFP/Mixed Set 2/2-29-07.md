Acute interstitial nephritis

The presence of eosinophiluria in a patient with acute kidney injury (AKI) suggests acute interstitial nephritis, which is typically an allergic reaction to medications such as penicillins, sulfa-containing antibiotics and diuretics, NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors, etc. Patients with acute interstitial nephritis may also present with a rash, fever, eosinophilia, and other constitutional symptoms. The combination of elevated levels of creatine kinase or myoglobin, a dipstick positive for blood but negative for RBCs, and a history of muscle trauma would suggest rhabdomyolysis. An elevated uric acid level along with a history of rapidly proliferating tumors or recent chemotherapy suggests tumor lysis syndrome and malignancy. Poisoning with ethylene glycol or methanol should be suspected in a patient with AKI and altered mental status with an increased anion gap and osmolar gap. An elevated antistreptolysin O titer suggests poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis when combined with a history of recent pharyngitis.
