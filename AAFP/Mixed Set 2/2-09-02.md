Polyethylene glycol (MiraLax)

Constipation is a very common side effect of opioids that does not resolve with time, unlike many other adverse effects. Constipation is easier to prevent than to treat, so it is important to start an appropriate bowel regimen with the initiation of opioid therapy. Fiber supplements and detergents (such as docusate) are inadequate for the prevention of opioid-induced constipation. Metoclopramide is used for nausea and increases gastric motility, but is not indicated in the treatment of constipation. Polyethylene glycol, lactulose, magnesium hydroxide, and senna with docusate are all appropriate in this situation.
