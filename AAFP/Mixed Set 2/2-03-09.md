Pseudogynecomastia

This patient most likely has pseudogynecomastia due to increases in subareolar fat secondary to his obesity. This is based upon clinical findings of symmetric adipose tissue in the breast region bilaterally and a lack of firm, palpable glandular tissue in the nipple and areolar region. In gynecomastia, there is palpable, firm glandular tissue in a concentric mass around the nipple-areola complex. Hard, immobile masses, masses associated with skin changes, nipple retraction, nipple discharge, or enlarged lymph nodes would suggest possible malignancy. Fat necrosis would involve a history of breast region trauma and would generally be asymmetric. Mastitis would cause clinical signs of infection.
