220/120 mm Hg

Elevated blood pressure may have a protective effect in the initial period after an ischemic stroke, and studies have shown adverse outcomes when it is lowered in the acute period. Blood pressure usually will spontaneously decrease without treatment in the first several hours after presentation, and antihypertensive treatment should not be started in the first 24 hours after an acute stroke unless blood pressure exceeds 220/120 mm Hg, or treatment is warranted because of another medical condition such as acute myocardial infarction. Tighter blood pressure control becomes more important after the first 24 hours.
