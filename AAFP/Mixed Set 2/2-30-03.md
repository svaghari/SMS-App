Sertraline (Zoloft)

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in approximately 20% of women and 8% of men exposed to traumatic events. Symptoms of PTSD include reexperiencing the event, depression, anxiety, changes in behavior, restlessness, social withdrawal, hypervigilance, poor attention, irritability, and fear. Many people with PTSD suffer from anxiety, depression, and substance abuse, and as many as one in five attempt suicide. Treatment with a combination of trauma-focused therapy and medications is recommended. SSRIs and SNRIs are considered first-line treatment. While paroxetine and sertraline are the only ones FDA-approved for PTSD, any of these drugs may be used. Other antidepressant medications can be used but are considered second-line treatment. Benzodiazepines have been used to treat the symptoms of hyperarousal but can worsen other PTSD symptoms and should be avoided. Studies of mood stabilizers in the treatment of PTSD have been mixed and many guidelines discourage their use. Antipsychotic medications are also not recommended. A large multi-site trial of risperidone reported no benefit over placebo.
