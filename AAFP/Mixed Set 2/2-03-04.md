Acetazolamide (Diamox Sequels) started the day before arriving at altitude

Acute mountain sickness is common in people traveling to altitudes higher than 8200 ft. Symptoms include headache and at least one of the following: nausea or vomiting, anorexia, dizziness or lightheadedness, fatigue or weakness, and difficulty sleeping. Slow ascent is the most effective way to prevent acute mountain sickness. Acetazolamide or dexamethasone can be used for both prevention and treatment. Ataxia and altered mental status are signs of cerebral edema and occur with end-stage acute mountain sickness. This can progress to coma and death and requires prompt treatment and descent. High-altitude pulmonary edema can occur without acute mountain sickness. Alcohol consumption on the first day at altitude can exacerbate acute mountain sickness.
