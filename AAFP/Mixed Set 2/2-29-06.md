Between 27 and 36 weeks gestation

Due to the increasing incidence of pertussis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all pregnant women receive Tdap vaccine during every pregnancy regardless of when their last dose was. It is ideally administered between 27 and 36 weeks gestation to maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant.
