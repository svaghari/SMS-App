The inability to bear weight to walk since the injury

The Ottawa Ankle Rules should be used to rule out fracture and prevent unnecessary radiographs. According to these guidelines, ankle radiographs are needed if there is pain over the malleolus plus bony tenderness over potential fracture areas, or an inability to bear weight and walk four steps immediately after the injury and in the emergency department or physicianâ€™s office (SOR A).
