Benzodiazepines

In 2010, opioid analgesics were implicated in 75% of pharmaceutical-related overdose deaths. Benzodiazepines were involved in 30% of these opioid analgesicâ€“related deaths. Conversely, opioids were a factor in 77% of pharmaceutical overdose deaths that involved benzodiazepines.

Antidepressants are involved in less than half as many opioid deaths as benzodiazepines. Antipsychotics, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants are implicated in opioid overdose deaths with far less frequency than benzodiazepines.
