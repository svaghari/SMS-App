Acute respiratory distress syndrome

This patient demonstrates classic findings for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In many cases ARDS must be differentiated from heart failure. Heart failure is characterized by fluid overload (edema), jugular venous distention, a third heart sound, an elevated BNP level, and a salutary response to diuretics. A BNP level <100 pg/mL can help rule out heart failure (SOR A). In addition, a patient with ARDS would not have signs of left atrial hypertension and overt volume overload.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is usually preceded by exposure to an inciting organic antigen such as bird feathers, mold, or dust. Pulmonary embolus, while certainly in the differential, is unlikely to cause such dramatic radiographic findings. Pneumothorax would be seen on the chest radiograph.
