ICU-associated delirium

Atypical antipsychotics may reduce the duration of delirium in adult intensive-care patients, and are recommended by the American College of Critical Care Medicine in their clinical practice guidelines for the management of pain, agitation, and delirium in adult patients in the intensive-care unit.

The American Geriatrics Society and the American Psychiatric Association (APA) recommend not using antipsychotics as a first choice to treat the behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia, such as aggression and resistance to care. These drugs have limited benefit and can cause serious harm, including stroke and premature death. The APA also recommends against routinely prescribing two or more antipsychotic medications concurrently, and against routinely prescribing antipsychotic medications as a first-line intervention for insomnia in adults.
