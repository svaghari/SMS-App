Left bundle branch block

Left bundle branch block makes the EKG uninterpretable during an exercise stress test, and can also interfere with nuclear imaging performed during the test. It is associated with transient positive defects in the anteroseptal and septal regions in the absence of a lesion within the left anterior descending coronary artery. This leads to a high rate of false-positive tests and low specificity. Pharmacologic stress tests using vasodilators such as adenosine with nuclear imaging have a much higher specificity and positive predictive value for LAD lesions, and the same is true for dobutamine stress echocardiography, which is why these are the preferred methods for evaluating patients with left bundle branch block. Pharmacologic stress testing would not be preferred for evaluating the other EKG abnormalities listed.
