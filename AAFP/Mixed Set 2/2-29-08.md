Ampicillin and cefotaxime (Claforan)

Any child younger than 29 days with a fever should undergo a complete sepsis workup and be admitted
for observation until culture results are obtained or the source of the fever is found and treated (SOR A).
The most common bacterial organisms in this age group are group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli.
However, many other pathogens have been known to cause sepsis; therefore, broad empiric coverage with
ampicillin and cefotaxime is recommended (SOR B). Gentamicin is commonly used, but should be used
in combination with ampicillin. Vancomycin is not recommended as first-line treatment unless the child
has evidence of a soft-tissue infection suspected to be methicillin resistant (SOR C). Ciprofloxacin and
clindamycin are not indicated treatments in this case.
