varicella zoster virus

This patient has herpes zoster oticus, which is also known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome when associated with a facial nerve palsy. It is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. Typical symptoms include painful vesicles on one side of the palate and the ipsilateral ear. When the reactivation involves other branches of the facial nerve it can result in a unilateral facial herpetiform rash that may also involve the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, taste disturbance, and reduced lacrimation. If the nearby cochlear and vestibular nerves become involved, patients may also experience hearing loss, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, and vertigo. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, but if confirmation is needed polymerase chain reaction testing of vesicular fluid or of a swab of the base of an ulcer may be done. Treatment includes antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir) and prednisone, and is more effective when started sooner in the course of illness.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause oral vesicles and ulcers, but the distribution of vesicles in the ear and the mouth of this patient is not typical for HSV. Epstein-Barr virus can cause leukoplakia of the mouth but not vesicles and is typically associated with systemic signs of illness. Group A Streptococcus causes throat pain and fever, not vesicles. Coxsackievirus causes oral vesicles and ulcers but is usually associated with fever and does not typically involve the ear.
