Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril)

Nonbenzodiazepine muscle relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine are beneficial for the relief of acute low back pain for the first 7â€“14 days after the onset of symptoms. Patient education, physical therapy, and the application of ice or heat may also help. Unsupported treatment options for acute low back pain include oral corticosteroids, acupuncture, lumbar support, massage, chiropractic spinal manipulation, and traction. Bed rest for acute low back pain is inadvisable.
