sex, height, and age

Blood pressure in children should be measured with an appropriate size cuff. Blood pressure standards are based on age, sex, and height, and provide a precise classification of blood pressure according to body size. Blood pressure tables for children now include the 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles by age, sex, and height (SOR A).
