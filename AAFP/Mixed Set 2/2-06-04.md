His previous episodes of severe hypoglycemia

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the single most important predictor of severe hypoglycemia is a previous history of severe hypoglycemia that required external assistance. It is thought that hypoglycemia reduces the bodyâ€™s protective responses (glucagon and epinephrine) to subsequent episodes of hypoglycemia (SOR C). Increased blood glucose level goals and increased self-monitoring of blood glucose are the most important measures for avoiding further episodes.

Less significant risk factors for hypoglycemia include advanced age, use of five or more medications, African-American ethnicity, and recent hospital discharge (SOR B). Diabetic autonomic neuropathy may be a risk factor but this has not been definitively established.
