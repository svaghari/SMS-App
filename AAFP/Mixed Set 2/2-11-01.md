Better short-term weight loss than with a low-fat diet

Emerging data on low-carbohydrate diets is mostly encouraging, in that these diets do not seem to cause the expected increases in blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol levels, or triglyceride levels that the medical community had first assumed. Although low-carbohydrate diets have been shown to result in clinically meaningful weight loss, reduced-calorie diets appear to result in similar weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasize. This patient has symptoms of metabolic syndrome and has a higher risk of glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus. Low-carbohydrate diets have been shown to reduce insulin resistance at least as well as, if not better than, traditional diet plans.
