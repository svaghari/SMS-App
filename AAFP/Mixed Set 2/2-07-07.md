The facility performing the mammogram

While it is certainly appropriate for the nurse practitioner or physician who ordered the test to notify the patient of mammography results, the facility performing the test is legally responsible. This is specified
by the federal Mammography Quality Standards Act, first passed by Congress in 1992.
