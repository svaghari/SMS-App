Deactivate the defibrillator

It is recommended that an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator be deactivated when it is inconsistent with the care goals of the patient and family. In about one-quarter of patients with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, the defibrillator delivers shocks in the weeks preceding death. For patients with advanced irreversible disease, defibrillator shocks rarely prevent death, may be painful, and are distressing to caregivers and family members. Advance care planning discussions should include the option of deactivating the implanted cardioverter-defibrillator when it no longer supports the patientâ€™s goals.
