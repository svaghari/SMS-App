Hand feeding

The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) position statement on feeding tubes states that percutaneous feeding tubes are not recommended for older adults with advanced dementia, and that careful hand feeding should be offered instead. This is the first recommendation by the AGS in the Choosing Wisely campaign.

Careful hand feeding for patients with severe dementia is at least as good as tube feeding with regard to the outcomes of death, aspiration pneumonia, functional status, and patient comfort. Regular food is preferred. Tube feeding is associated with agitation, increased use of physical and chemical restraints, and worsening pressure ulcers.

The preponderance of evidence does not support the use of tube feedings, based upon expert opinion and extensive observational data. Published empirical work using observational data is highly consistent regarding the lack of efficacy for tube feeding in this population.
