Graves disease

When there is a question about the cause of goiter and thyrotoxicosis, the presence of TSH receptor immunoglobulins indicates Graves disease. The prevalence of specific forms of TSH receptor site antibodies can distinguish Graves disease from Hashimoto’s disease. Both are autoimmune diseases, but in Graves disease there is a predominance of TSH receptor antibodies. In Hashimoto’s disease TSH receptor–blocking antibodies are more predominant. These immunoglobulins tend to disappear with therapy.
