48 hours after the initial antibiotic order

For patients started on empiric antibiotic therapy at hospital admission, the CDC recommends an antibiotic
time-out 48 hours after the initial order to determine if it can be stopped or needs to be changed. The dose,
route, and duration should also be reviewed. The rationale is that antibiotics are often ordered empirically
at the time of admission, while cultures and other studies are also being ordered. The original empiric
order should be reassessed, incorporating the results of these studies while considering the evolving clinical
status of the patient. Studies show this reassessment with antibiotic modification does not reliably occur.
