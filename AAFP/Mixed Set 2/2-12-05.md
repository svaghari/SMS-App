Urologic referral for surgical exploration

Treatment for a unilateral undescended testis should be started at 6â€“12 months of age to avoid testicular damage. It was once thought that delaying descent lowered the incidence of testicular cancer, but it is now believed that orchiopexy allows for early cancer detection. HCG treatment may promote descent into the distal canal, but the testicle often ascends again. Ultrasonography will not show an undescended testis in many cases and is therefore not recommended. Hormonal treatments have been used in Europe but randomized, controlled trials have not shown them to be effective.
