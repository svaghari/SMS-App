Stress fracture

Running injuries are primarily caused by overuse due to training errors. Runners should be instructed to increase their mileage gradually. A stress fracture causes localized tenderness and swelling in superficial bones, and the pain can be reproduced by having the patient jump on the affected leg. Plantar fasciitis causes burning pain in the heel and there is tenderness of the plantar fascia where it inserts onto the medial tubercle of the calcaneus.
