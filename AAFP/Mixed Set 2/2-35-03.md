Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) plus azithromycin

Gonorrhea continues to be a major cause of reproductive complications in women. Effective treatment is critical to control the spread of disease. Unfortunately, treatment has been complicated by the ability of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to develop resistance. The emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea has led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to no longer recommend the use of fluoroquinolones for treatment of gonorrhea. Cephalosporins are currently the only recommended antibiotic, with ceftriaxone being the preferred agent.

Patients with gonorrhea often have a Chlamydia infection as well. It is recommended that they be treated for both, even with a negative test for Chlamydia. The recommended regimen for treatment of gonorrhea is ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, and azithromycin, 1 g orally, or doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 7 days. All sexual partners in the previous 60 days should be treated as well.
