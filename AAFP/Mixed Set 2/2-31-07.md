Continue the current regimen

Current guidelines recommend that patients with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who also have atrial fibrillation take dual antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin plus clopidogrel and a vitamin K antagonist, with a goal INR of 2.0–3.0. If a patient was already taking a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) instead of warfarin for atrial fibrillation, the patient should continue with the DOAC in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy. The duration of triple therapy should be as short as possible, and aspirin can often be discontinued after 1–3 months. However, this patient’s STEMI occurred less than 2 weeks ago and he should continue triple therapy.
