Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Structural non-atherosclerotic heart disease is the predominant cause of sudden death in young athletes.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an autosomal dominant condition with variable expression, accounts for
more than one-third of these cases. Coronary artery abnormalities are second in frequency as a cause of
sudden cardiac death in this population, with idiopathic ventricular hypertrophy third.
