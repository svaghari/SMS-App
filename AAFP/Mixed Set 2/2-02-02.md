Withdraw life support

The most common form of advance directive is a patient’s conversations with relatives and friends, and these carry the same ethical and legal weight as written directives. Neither the hospital attorney nor the patient’s personal attorney, in the absence of a previous discussion with the patient, has the ethical or legal authority to make the decision. Since the patient has previously expressed his wishes, it is unnecessary to have the court appoint a surrogate decision maker. Care should be transferred to another physician only if the original physician has a philosophical or religious objection to carrying out the patient’s wishes.
