One dose after age 65

For a healthy nonsmoker with no chronic disease who is not in a high-risk group, pneumococcal vaccine is recommended once at age 65, or as soon afterward as possible. Persons that should be immunized before age 65 include patients with chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, immunocompromising conditions, or asplenia, and residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC updated the recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination in 2011 to include immunization for persons age 50â€“64 in the following categories: Alaska Natives, Native Americans living in areas of increased risk, persons with asthma, and smokers.
