Sinus bradycardia with hypotension

The main use of atropine in cases of cardiac arrest is for symptomatic bradycardia. It has little effect with
complete heart block and Mobitz type II atrioventricular block. It is not recommended or effective for
cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity or in cases of asystole. It has been removed from these
algorithms by the ACLS committee. During an acute myocardial infarction or acute cardiac ischemia, an
increase in heart rate may increase the amount of ischemia.
