Ethanol

The current management of methanol intoxication, depending on its severity, includes ethanol administration to inhibit the metabolism of methanol, hemodialysis to remove alcohol and its toxins, and vigorous management of metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate therapy. Ethanol is a competitive inhibitor of toxin metabolism and slows the formation of toxic metabolites, formaldehyde, and formic acid from methanol, permitting these products to be disposed of by ordinary metabolic or excretory pathways. It has a similar effect in ethylene glycol poisoning, slowing the formation of glycoaldehyde and glycolic, glyoxylic, and oxalic acids.
