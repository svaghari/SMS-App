fatal arrhythmia

In March of 2013 the FDA issued a safety warning regarding azithromycin and its potential to lead to serious and even fatal arrhythmias, particularly in at-risk patients. Risk factors include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, a prolonged QT interval, and the use of certain medications to treat abnormal heart rhythms. The mechanism of action is prolongation of the QT interval, leading to torsades de pointes (level of evidence 2, SOR A).

The FDA recommends that physicians consider the risk of torsades de pointes and fatal heart rhythms associated with azithromycin when considering antibiotic treatment options, particularly in patients who are already at risk for cardiovascular events.
