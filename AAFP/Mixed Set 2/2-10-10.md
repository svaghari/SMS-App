Osteoporosis

Patients who are diagnosed with celiac disease are at increased risk of osteoporosis due to bone loss from
decreased calcium and vitamin D absorption. These patients are at higher risk for fractures. Patients with
celiac disease are not at increased risk for inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, or colon cancer.
