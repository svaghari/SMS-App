A bolus of normal saline

This patient exhibits signs of possible sepsis, including fever, altered mental status, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Confirmation of a documented infection would establish the diagnosis, but treatment should be started before the infection is confirmed. Initial management includes respiratory stabilization. This patient responded to oxygen supplementation, but if he had not, mechanical ventilation would be indicated. The next appropriate step is fluid resuscitation. A bolus of intravenous fluids at 20 mL/kg over 30 minutes or less is recommended (SOR A). Vasopressors should be started if a patient does not respond to intravenous fluids as evidenced by an adequate increase in mean arterial pressure and organ perfusion (SOR B). First-line agents include dopamine and norepinephrine. Vasopressin may be added but has not been shown to improve mortality. Bicarbonate therapy is not usually recommended to improve hemodynamic status. Hydrocortisone may be used in patients who do not respond to fluids and vasopressors.
