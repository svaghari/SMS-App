Joint contracture

Stretching is often included in comprehensive treatment programs for musculoskeletal injuries and chronic
conditions, making the determination of how much of the benefit is derived specifically from the stretching
component difficult. Trials using different stretching techniques have demonstrated measurable benefit
from a tailored stretching program for each of the options listed, with the exception of joint contracture.
This mobility-impairing condition results from post-healing shortness of noncontractile tissues that are not
easily released with stretching.

When applied to healing tissues, stretching is thought to increase muscle length and align collagen fibers,
thereby increasing range of motion and flexibility post healing. A program that includes static, dynamic,
and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching increases range of motion post knee
replacement. Static and PNF stretching increases range of motion in osteoarthritis of the knee. A program
of precontraction and static stretching increases hamstring flexibility following a strain. A yearlong
stretching program for relief of chronic neck pain has been shown to have a benefit equal to that of
strengthening exercises or manual therapy.
