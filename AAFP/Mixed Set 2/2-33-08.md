<70% of predicted

Suspected COPD should be confirmed by spirometry in stable patients, based on a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio <70% of predicted (SOR C). While guidelines for the treatment of COPD differ slightly among the leading national and international organizations, most have come to a consensus on using this criterion for the diagnosis (SOR C).
