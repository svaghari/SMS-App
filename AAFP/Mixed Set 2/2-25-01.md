Administration of dexamethasone, 0.6 mg/kg orally in a single dose

This patient has mild croup based on the clinical findings. A single dose of dexamethasone is recommended
in all cases of croup (SOR A). Hospitalization is not necessary if the child is stable. Racemic epinephrine,
which has been shown to reduce symptoms at 30 minutes but not at 2 hours or 6 hours, is recommended
for the treatment of moderate to severe croup when patients are being observed in a medical setting such
as the emergency department or hospital (SOR A). Amoxicillin and albuterol are not indicated in the
management of croup.
