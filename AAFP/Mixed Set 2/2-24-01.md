Hypogonadism

Hypogonadism is an often underrecognized and undertreated side effect of long-term opioid therapy. It is more often seen in men and in patients receiving larger doses of opioids, including intrathecally. Typical symptoms include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or fatigue.

Constipation is not uncommon in patients on chronic opioid therapy, especially if they are elderly, have limited mobility, or are concurrently using other constipating medications. Sedation can occur in the first few weeks after starting therapy but usually tapers off. Hyperalgesia (not hypoalgesia) and allodynia are other side effects resulting from chronic opioid therapy. Respiratory depression is infrequent (SOR C).
