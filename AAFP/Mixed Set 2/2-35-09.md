IgG testing for Bartonella henselae

Bartonella henselae is the organism that causes cat-scratch disease. IgG titers over 1:256 strongly suggest active or recent infection. IgM elevation suggests acute disease but production of IgM is brief. Lymph node biopsy is reserved for cases where node swelling fails to resolve or the diagnosis is uncertain. The organism is difficult to culture and cultures are not recommended. Nontuberculous mycobacteria do not cause cat-scratch disease (SOR C).
