There are no proven therapies to reduce the severity of borderline personality disorder (SOR A). The most promising psychological therapy is dialectic behavioral therapy (DBT). DBT is a multi-faceted program specifically designed to treat borderline personality disorder. The few, small studies of DBT found improvement in many symptoms of borderline personality disorder, but long-term data is lacking. Another promising therapy is psychoanalytic-oriented day hospital therapy. Again, study sizes have been small and data cannot be extrapolated to the population as a whole.
Omega-3 fatty acids, second-generation antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers have been shown to be helpful for some symptoms of borderline personality disorder but not for overall severity. Their benefits are based on single-study results and side effects were not addressed in the studies. SSRIs are not recommended for borderline personality disorder unless there is a concomitant mood disorder.
