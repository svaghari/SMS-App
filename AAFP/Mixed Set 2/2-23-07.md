Headache lasting longer than 60 hours

The majority of symptoms associated with sports-related concussions resolve within 72 hours of injury. However, some concussions result in prolonged recovery periods. Risk factors associated with a prolonged recovery include headaches lasting 60 hours or more, self-reported fatigue or fogginess, and four or more symptoms at the onset of injury (SOR B). Loss of consciousness and amnesia have not been found to be related to recovery time. Convulsions associated with the injury are benign and do not affect prognosis. Nausea is one of the symptoms of concussion, but by itself is not a risk factor for prolonged recovery.
