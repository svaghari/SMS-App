A 7-mm lesion on the nose

Treating basal cell carcinoma with Mohs micrographic surgery leads to the lowest recurrence rate. Because of its cost and limited availability, however, this procedure should be limited to tumors with a higher risk for recurrence. Risk factors include larger size, more invasive histologic subtypes (micronodular, infiltrative, and morpheaform), and sites associated with a higher risk of recurrence.

High-risk locations include the “mask” areas of the face, which include the central face, eyelids, eyebrows, periorbital area, nose, lips (cutaneous and vermilion), chin, mandible, preauricular and postauricular skin/sulci, temple, and ear. Other high-risk sites include the genitalia, hands, and feet. Moderate-risk locations include the cheeks, forehead, scalp, and neck. All other areas, including the trunk and extremities, are low-risk areas.

Even with a low-risk location, a lesion that is ≥20 mm in size has a high risk of recurrence. With a moderate-risk location a lesion ≥10 mm in size carries a higher risk of recurrence, and a lesion ≥6 mm in size is considered high risk in a high-risk location.
