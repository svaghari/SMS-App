Cognitive-behavioral therapy

The criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome include fatigue for 6 months and a minimum of four of the following physical symptoms: impaired memory, postexertional malaise, muscle pain, polyarthralgia, tender lymph nodes, sore throat, new headaches, and unrefreshing sleep. Both cognitive-behavioral therapy and graded exercise therapy have been shown to improve fatigue levels, anxiety, work/social adjustment, and postexertional malaise (SOR A). Treatments that have not been shown to be effective include methylphenidate, melatonin, and galantamine. Citalopram has not been shown to be effective in the absence of a comorbid diagnosis of depression.
