Elder abuse

This patient has numerous red flags for elder abuse, including unexplained weight loss, reliance on a caregiver, a disheveled appearance, a pressure ulcer, and bruising in locations that are not typically associated with unintentional trauma from falls. Although the other listed causes of bruising are possible, in this scenario the index of suspicion should be highest for elder abuse.
