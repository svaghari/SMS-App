A levonorgestrel intrauterine device (Mirena)

Certain antiepileptic drugs induce hepatic metabolism of estrogen and progestin (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and topiramate). This can potentially lead to failure of any contraceptive that contains estrogen and progestin. Progestin-only pills are most effective in women who are exclusively breastfeeding. They are not as effective in pregnancy prevention in other circumstances. Another effective option for women taking antiepileptic medications would be an intrauterine device. The levonorgestrel (progestin only) IUD and copper IUD are acceptable choices even for a nulligravida. The single-rod implantable progestin system also would be an acceptable choice for this patient.
