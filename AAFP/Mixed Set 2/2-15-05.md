Prompt ophthalmologic evaluation

If a metal foreign body is present on the cornea for more than 24 hours a rust ring will often be present in the superficial layer of the cornea. This material is toxic to the cornea and should be removed as soon as possible, but it is not an emergency. The proper removal of a rust ring requires the use of a slit lamp and specialized ophthalmic equipment. Referral to an eye specialist within 24â€“48 hours is the best management in this case.
