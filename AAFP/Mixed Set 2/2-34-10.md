Follow-up examination in 1 month

Localized or generalized lymphadenopathy is a common complaint in children. Most cases are benign and related to infections or connective tissue disorders. Initial management involves watchful waiting for up to 4 weeks (SOR C). Evidence to support treatment with antibiotics is lacking and should be reserved for patients who show evidence of local inflammation. Malignancy should be excluded if lymphadenopathy persists beyond 4 weeks, or if other symptoms develop, such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, or orthopnea. In this situation, the evaluation should include a CBC, blood smear, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and chest radiography (SOR C).
