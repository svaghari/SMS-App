Iliotibial band syndrome

This case illustrates the classic history and physical findings of iliotibial band syndrome. Pain occurs most frequently at the site where the tendon crosses over the lateral femoral epicondyle. With osteoarthritis or a meniscal tear there would be pain in the joint space with palpation. Osgood-Schlatter disease is more common in younger adolescents and is characterized by tenderness of the tibial tubercle at the distal insertion of the patellar ligament. Pes anserine bursitis is characterized by pain in the medial knee distal to the joint space, at the conjoined tendon of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus.
