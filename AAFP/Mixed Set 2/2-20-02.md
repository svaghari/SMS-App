While anyone, even previously healthy individuals, may benefit from treatment of symptomatic clinical influenza infection with antiviral agents, not everyone who has been exposed but is asymptomatic requires chemoprophylaxis. However, persons at higher risk for complications from influenza should be considered for preventive treatment. Those at highest risk include children under the age of 2 years, pregnant women (including women less than 2 weeks post partum), adults over the age of 65, the morbidly obese (BMI >40 kg/m2), and Native or Alaskan Americans. If persons at high risk for influenza complications are not treated prophylactically with antiviral agents after exposure, then they should receive prompt treatment as soon as possible after developing signs and symptoms of influenza infection.
