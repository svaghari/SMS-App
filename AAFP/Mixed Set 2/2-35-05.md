Reassurance and supportive care

This patient has a diagnosis of laryngitis (a viral infection causing inflammation of the vocal cords lasting less than 3 weeks). Symptoms of laryngitis can include loss/muffling of the voice, as well as other classic symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. A Cochrane study has shown that antibiotic therapy does not decrease the duration of laryngitis symptoms or hasten the return of vocal patency (SOR A). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration no longer recommends the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medications for children under the age of 2 years, because of their serious and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, including respiratory arrest due to hypopnea (SOR B).
