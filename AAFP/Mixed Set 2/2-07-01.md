Plain radiography

The most likely diagnosis for this patientâ€™s knee pain is osteoarthritis. While he is likely to have disease in both knees, it is common for patients to have unilateral symptoms, especially early on. Although osteoarthritis is mainly a clinical diagnosis, plain radiography is the diagnostic study of choice if there is concern about other diagnostic possibilities. Narrowing of the medial compartment of the knee joint is typically the first radiographic finding; osteophytes are also commonly seen on plain films. In the scenario presented here, there is no need for laboratory testing at this time.
