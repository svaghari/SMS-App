B-type natriuretic peptide

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a 32–amino acid polypeptide secreted from the cardiac ventricles in response to ventricular volume expansion and pressure overload. The major source of BNP is the cardiac ventricles, and because of the minimal presence of BNP in storage granules, its release is directly proportional to ventricular dysfunction. A BNP test is simple and time efficient, and reliably predicts the presence or absence of left ventricular dysfunction on an echocardiogram.
