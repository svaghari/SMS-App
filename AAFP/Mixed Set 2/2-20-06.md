Viruses cause 80% of infectious conjunctivitis cases and viral conjunctivitis usually requires no treatment. Bacterial conjunctivitis is associated with mattering and adherence of the eyelids. Topical antibiotics reduce the duration of bacterial conjunctivitis but have no effect on viral conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis would be more likely if the patient reported itching. Antibiotics or corticosteroids would not be helpful in this patient, and would not prevent complications.

The majority of cases of viral conjunctivitis are caused by adenoviruses, which cause pharyngeal conjunctival fever and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Pharyngeal conjunctival fever is characterized by high fever, pharyngitis, and bilateral eye inflammation. Keratoconjunctivitis occurs in epidemics, and is associated with a watery discharge, hyperemia, and ipsilateral lymphadenopathy in >50% of cases.
