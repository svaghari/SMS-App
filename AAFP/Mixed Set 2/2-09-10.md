Pityriasis rosea

In 50%–90% of patients, pityriasis rosea starts with an erythematous, scaly, oval patch a few centimeters in diameter. This is usually followed within a few days by smaller patches on the trunk and sometimes the proximal extremities. Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare disease with five types. The classic adult type begins with a small red plaque on the face or upper body that gradually spreads to become a generalized eruption. The other conditions listed typically begin with multiple lesions.
