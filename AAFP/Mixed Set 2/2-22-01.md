Provide reassurance to the patient and his family

This case is consistent with physiologic genu valgus, and the parents should be reassured. Toddlers under 2 years of age typically have a varus angle at the knee (bowlegs). This transitions to physiologic genu valgus, which gradually normalizes by around 6 years of age. As this condition is physiologic, therapies such as surgical intervention, special bracing, and exercise programs are not indicated.
