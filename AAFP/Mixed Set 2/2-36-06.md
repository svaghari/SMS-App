the cricothyroid membrane

Fortunately, emergency tracheotomy is not often necessary, but should one be necessary the best site for the incision is directly above the cricoid cartilage, through the cricothyroid membrane. Strictly speaking, this is not a tracheotomy, because it is actually above the trachea. However, it is below the vocal cords and bypasses any laryngeal obstruction. The thyrohyoid membrane lies well above the vocal cords, making this an impractical site. The area directly below the cricoid cartilage—which includes the second, third, and fourth tracheal rings, as well as the thyroid isthmus—is the preferred tracheotomy site under controlled circumstances, but excessive bleeding and difficulty finding the trachea may significantly impede the procedure in an emergency.
