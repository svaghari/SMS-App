Erythromycin

Coral-red fluorescence on Woodâ€™s light examination is typical of infection with Corynebacterium minutissimum, a condition known as erythrasma. This organism commonly complicates intertrigo, often in the groin or interdigital spaces. Erythromycin is the most effective treatment for this bacterial infection.
