Interferon-gamma release assays

Most Hispanic immigrants have received the bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine. Although past practice has been to interpret skin test results without regard to BCG status, false-positive tests in this population are common. Interferon-y release assays are preferred to tuberculin skin testing in immigrants who have been vaccinated with BCG.
