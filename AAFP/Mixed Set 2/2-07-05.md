Clindamycin (Cleocin)

This patient most likely has an anaerobic bacterial infection. Penicillin was used to treat these infections in the past, but because of the emergence of β-lactamase–producing organisms, clindamycin is now the drug of choice. Clindamycin has broader coverage against both pulmonary anaerobes and facultative aerobes such as Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella, which are often seen with lung abscesses. Metronidazole has anaerobic coverage, but not for the anaerobic species often involved in pulmonary infections, and is therefore associated with a high failure rate when used to treat lung abscesses. Doxycycline does not cover anaerobes. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is also not considered a good anaerobic antibiotic.
