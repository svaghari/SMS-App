Cervical mucus monitoring

Natural family planning (NFP) is a potentially effective method for contraception and for determining the time of ovulation for purposes of conception. While the contraceptive effectiveness of the different NFP methods varies significantly, the success rates for typical use are as high as 92%–98% (SOR B). Monitoring the presence and consistency of cervical mucus production allows for the determination of both the beginning and end of a woman’s most fertile period. Some NFP methods use cervical mucus secretion as the sole basis for determining fertility. The symptothermal method also incorporates calendar calculations, basal body temperature measurement, and ovulation-related symptoms as a complement to the cervical mucus component. The Marquette Model incorporates cervical mucus and basal body temperature charting with electronic monitoring of urine estrogen and LH metabolites to provide additional information to determine when ovulation has occurred.
