intractable pain

The primary indication for joint replacement surgery in patients with osteoarthritis is intractable pain, which is almost always relieved by the surgery.  Joint replacement may also be appropriate for patients with significant limitations of joint function or with altered limb alignment. Range of motion, joint laxity, and recurrent subluxation relate to musculotendinous function, and are not reliably improved by joint replacement.
