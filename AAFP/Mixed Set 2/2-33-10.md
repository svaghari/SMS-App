her reported symptoms

based on the patient’s symptoms rather than documented evidence of infection (SOR C). In healthy premenopausal women with no history of a urinary tract functional abnormality, current pregnancy, or another underlying condition that may increase the risk of treatment failure, infection can be presumed based on symptoms. Patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis are not febrile and have no vaginal symptoms. Men and children, as well as women who do not meet these criteria, require in-person evaluation.

A urine dipstick has relatively low sensitivity and specificity for urinary tract infection (SOR A). Negative dipstick results do not reliably rule out infection in a patient with strongly positive symptoms. A midstream culture is as good as or better than a urinary catheter–obtained specimen (SOR B). However, neither of these is required for the diagnosis or treatment of uncomplicated acute cystitis.
