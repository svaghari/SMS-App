Start an intravenous infusion of hypertonic saline

Head trauma is a known cause of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). This patientâ€™s course has been very acute, with hyponatremia developing within 48 hours. Such a precipitous drop in serum sodium may lead to cerebral and pulmonary edema. If left untreated the patient can have seizures, become obtunded, and die from brain herniation. These dangers require immediate treatment with hypertonic saline to correct the falling levels of sodium. This must be done cautiously so as to not overcorrect the sodium level too quickly, which could lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome. An increase in serum sodium levels of about 6 mEq/L should be enough to reduce symptoms and prevent progressive cerebral edema.
