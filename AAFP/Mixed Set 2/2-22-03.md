Glucocorticoids

Topical intranasal glucocorticoids are currently believed to be the most efficacious medications for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. They are far superior to oral preparations in terms of safety. Cromolyn sodium is also an effective topical agent for allergic rhinitis; however, it is more effective if started prior to the season of peak symptoms. Because of the high risk of rhinitis medicamentosa with chronic use of topical decongestants, these agents have limited usefulness in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

Azelastine, an intranasal antihistamine, is effective for controlling symptoms but can cause somnolence and a bitter taste. Oral antihistamines are not as useful for congestion as for sneezing, pruritus, and rhinorrhea. Overall, they are not as effective as topical glucocorticoids.
