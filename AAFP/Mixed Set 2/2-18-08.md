Objective evidence of memory decline

Mild cognitive impairment is an intermediate stage between normal cognitive function and dementia. Motor function remains normal. The presence of the APO E4 allele is a risk factor, but is not necessary for a diagnosis. Patients have essentially normal functional activities but there is objective evidence of memory impairment, and the patient may express concerns about cognitive decline.
