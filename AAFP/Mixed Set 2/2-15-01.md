Ultrasonography of the right hip

The most likely diagnosis is septic arthritis of the hip. Ultrasonography is highly sensitive for the effusion seen in septic arthritis, which can be aspirated to confirm the diagnosis (SOR A). It is important to diagnose this problem as soon as possible. Clinical features of septic arthritis include an oral temperature >38.5°C (101.3°F), refusal to bear weight on the affected leg, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate >40 mm/hr, a peripheral WBC count >12,000/mm3, and a C-reactive protein level >20 mg/L. If ultrasonography is negative, a bone scan should be done. CT of the hip is indicated to visualize cortical bone. MRI is especially valuable for osteomyelitis.
