Evaluation with the Geriatric Depression Scale or the PHQ-9

While some workup may be indicated, it is also important to realize that depression may present with fatigue and vague symptoms, particularly in the geriatric population. The Geriatric Depression Scale and PHQ-9 are good screening tests for depression and would help to determine if more focus should be placed on a mood disorder. If further evaluation leads to a diagnosis of depression an SSRI may be indicated but paroxetine is not the first choice in the elderly because of its long half-life. In addition, its concentrations are increased 70%â€“80% in the elderly compared to younger adults, its clearance is decreased, and it has multiple side effects and drug interactions.

An EKG and stress testing are unlikely to be beneficial in a patient who has no significant symptoms and few risk factors for coronary artery disease. Pulmonary function testing may be helpful later in the evaluation if the initial workup does not reveal a diagnosis, but would not be indicated at this time given the lack of respiratory symptoms. A referral to Adult Protective Services is not warranted for suspected depression but would be an option if there were a reasonable suspicion of abuse in a patient and medical causes have been ruled out.
