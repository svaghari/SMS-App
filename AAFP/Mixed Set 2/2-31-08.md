Frozen shoulder

Frozen shoulder is an inflammatory contracture of the shoulder capsule and mostly affects the anterosuperior and anteroinferior capsular ligaments, limiting glenohumeral movement. Diabetic patients have a 10%â€“20% lifetime risk of frozen shoulder. Only two other common conditions selectively limit passive external rotation: locked posterior dislocation and osteoarthritis. Plain films of the shoulder should reveal both conditions. Rotator cuff tears do not limit passive range of motion, and calcific tendinitis has a characteristic radiographic appearance.
