Discontinue hydralazine

There are many drugs that can induce a syndrome resembling systemic lupus erythematosus, but the most common offenders are antiarrhythmics such as procainamide. Hydralazine is also a common cause. There is a genetic predisposition for this drug-induced lupus, determined by drug acetylation rates. Polyarthritis and pleuropericarditis occur in half of patients, but CNS or renal involvement is rare. While all patients with this condition have positive antinuclear antibody titers and most have antibodies to histones, antibodies to double-stranded DNA and decreased complement levels are rare, which distinguishes drug-induced lupus from idiopathic lupus.

The best initial management for drug-induced lupus is to withdraw the drug, and most patients will improve in a few weeks. For those with severe symptoms, a short course of corticosteroids is indicated. Once the offending drug is discontinued, symptoms seldom last beyond 6 months.
