Hypothyroidism

Children with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for retinopathy, nephropathy, and hypertension. They are also more likely to have immune-mediated disorders such as celiac disease and hypothyroidism. For all children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the American Diabetes Association recommends screening for hypothyroidism, nephropathy, hypertension, celiac disease, and retinopathy. Screening for dyslipidemia should be considered if there is a family history of hypercholesterolemia or cardiac events before age 55.
