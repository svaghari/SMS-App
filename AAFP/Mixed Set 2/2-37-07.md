Ketorolac

Naltrexone is given in 380-mg monthly injections for the chronic treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence. It is an antagonist of I-opioid receptors, and blocks the pain relief properties of opioid agonists. Regional anesthesia and/or nonopioid analgesics are indicated when urgent pain relief is needed in a patient on long-term naltrexone therapy. Ketorolac is the only medication listed that is not an opioid agonist.
