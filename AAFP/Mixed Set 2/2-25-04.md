histoplasmosis

Asymptomatic patients in excellent health often present with this characteristic chest radiograph pattern,
which is usually due to histoplasmosis infection, especially if the patient has been in the midwestern United
States. Exposure to bird or bat excrement is a common cause, and treatment is usually not needed. This
pattern is not characteristic of the other infections listed, although miliary tuberculosis is a remote
possibility despite the negative PPD skin test.
