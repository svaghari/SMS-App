Candida albicans

Intertrigo is skin inflammation caused by skin-on-skin friction. It is facilitated by moisture trapped in deep skinfolds where air circulation is limited. When intertrigo does not respond to usual conservative measures, including keeping the skin clean and dry, evaluation for infection is recommended. A Wood’s light examination, KOH preparation, and exudate culture can assist in identifying causative organisms.
The moist, damaged skin associated with intertrigo is a fertile breeding ground for various microorganisms, and secondary cutaneous infections are commonly observed in these areas. Candida is the organism most commonly associated with intertrigo. In the interdigital spaces dermatophytes (e.g., Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum) are more common. Staphylococcus aureus may present alone or with group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, or Proteus vulgaris also may occur alone or simultaneously.
