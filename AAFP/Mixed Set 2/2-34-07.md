Serum LH and FSH levels

This patient suffers from secondary amenorrhea (defined as the cessation of regular menses for 3 months or irregular menses for 6 months). The most common causes of secondary amenorrhea are polycystic ovary syndrome, primary ovarian failure, hypothalamic amenorrhea, and hyperprolactinemia. With a normal physical examination, negative pregnancy test, and no history of chronic disease, a hormonal workup is indicated, including TSH, LH, and FSH levels (SOR C).

A hormonal challenge with medroxyprogesterone to provoke withdrawal bleeding is used to assess functional anatomy and estrogen levels (SOR C). However, it has poor specificity and sensitivity for ovarian function and a poor correlation with estrogen levels.

Pelvic ultrasonography is indicated in the workup of primary amenorrhea to confirm the presence of a uterus and detect structural abnormalities of the reproductive organs. Likewise, karyotyping can be used for patients with primary amenorrhea, as conditions such as Turnerâ€™s syndrome and androgen insensitivity syndrome are due to chromosomal abnormalities.

A CBC and metabolic panel would not be initial considerations in the workup of amenorrhea unless the patient has a known chronic disease which may affect the results.
