Constipation

The Rome criteria define constipation as the presence of two or more of the following: straining on defecation, hard stools, incomplete evacuation, or less than three bowel movements per week. This patient has multiple symptoms on this list. The presence of watery bowel movements does not rule out the diagnosis of constipation, as it is common for liquid stool to pass an obstructive source.
