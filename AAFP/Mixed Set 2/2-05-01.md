Topical testosterone

This patient meets the criteria for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). The incidence of this condition is variable based on the age, life stage, and culture of the patient, but is estimated to be present in about 5%–15% of the adult female population. This diagnosis includes two components: (1) recurrent deficiency or absence of sexual desire or receptivity to sexual activity, and (2) distress about such a deficiency. In menstruating women, oral estrogen and oral sildenafil have not been shown to be superior to placebo. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been shown to be helpful for other sexual dysfunctions, but not with HSDD. Topical testosterone, in either patch or gel form, has shown consistent improvements in arousal, desire, fantasy, orgasm, and overall satisfaction in cases of HSDD.
