Reduced FVC and an increased FEV1/FVC ratio

A full set of pulmonary function tests consists of spirometry, helium lung volume measurements, and the measurement of diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). A bronchodilator challenge will allow assessment of reversible airway obstruction. A methacholine challenge test can also be used to look for airway hyperreactivity. A reduced FVC with either a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio is consistent with restrictive lung disease. There are three basic categories of restrictive lung disease: intrinsic lung disease, chest wall deformities, and neuromuscular disorders. A reduced FEV1 and decreased FEV1/FVC ratio is seen in obstructive lung disease (asthma, COPD). The DLCO is the measure of the diffusion of carbon monoxide across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Reduced values are obtained when interstitial fibrosis is extensive, or when the capillary surface is compromised by vascular obstruction or nonperfusion, or is destroyed (as in emphysema).
