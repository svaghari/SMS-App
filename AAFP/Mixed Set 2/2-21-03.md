Behavioral treatment alone

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, preschool-age children with ADHD should receive behavioral therapy alone, administered by a parent and/or teacher. Initially prescribing behavioral therapy alone is supported by strong overall evidence and also by a study finding that many preschool-age children with moderate to severe dysfunction had improved symptoms with behavioral therapy alone. If significant improvement is not observed, then methylphenidate can be added. Medications combined with behavioral therapy should be prescribed in elementary schoolâ€“age children. Evidence for the use of stimulants is strong, and evidence for the use of atomoxetine is sufficient, but not as strong as for the stimulants.
