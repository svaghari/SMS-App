antiphospholipid antibody syndrome

The most common inhibitor discovered during the evaluation of an elevated aPTT is an antiphospholipid antibody. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is characterized by venous or arterial thromboembolism and recurrent spontaneous abortion, often in the second trimester, due to placental infarction. Protein C deficiency is associated with recurrent deep vein thrombophlebitis, but does not cause elevation of aPTT. Hemophilia A is associated with an elevated aPTT which corrects with the addition of normal plasma. In chronic liver disease one would expect an elevation of the prothrombin time also. Von Willebrand disease is not associated with thrombophlebitis or recurrent abortion.
