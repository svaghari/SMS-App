No testing

Most watery diarrhea is self-limited and testing is not indicated. A diagnostic workup is usually reserved for patients with severe dehydration or illness, diarrhea persisting for more than 3â€“7 days, fever, bloody stool, immunosuppression, or a history suggesting nosocomial infection or an outbreak. Indiscriminate use of laboratory testing is inefficient and not cost-effective.
