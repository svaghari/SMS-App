Start magnesium sulfate and induce labor now

This patient likely has severe preeclampsia based on her elevated blood pressure with 4+ protein on her urinalysis. Patients with severe preeclampsia near term should be placed on magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures, and labor should be induced immediately. An urgent cesarean section is not necessary. Corticosteroids have not been shown to improve neonatal outcomes when given after 34 weeks gestation. Elevated blood pressures can be managed with hydralazine and labetalol. Normalizing blood pressure is not recommended, but these drugs should be used when blood pressure is over 160/105 mm Hg.
