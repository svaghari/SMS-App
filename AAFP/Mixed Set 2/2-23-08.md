Compression ultrasonography

In patients at intermediate to high risk for deep vein thrombosis, compression ultrasonography is the initial diagnostic test of choice. In low-risk patients, a negative D-dimer has a high enough negative predictive value to essentially rule out deep vein thrombosis. It is not sensitive or specific enough for evaluating intermediate-risk patients. Initiating treatment based on pretest probability would be inappropriate. Impedance plethysmography is not readily available, and contrast venography is too invasive to be used routinely.
