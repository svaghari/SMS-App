SGLT2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin (Invokana)

SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit SGLT2 in the proximal nephron. This blocks glucose reabsorption by the kidney,
increasing glucosuria. The advantages of this medication include no hypoglycemia, decreased weight,
decreased blood pressure, and effectiveness at all stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Disadvantages are that
it increases the risk of genitourinary infections, polyuria, and volume depletion and increases
LDL-cholesterol and creatinine levels. GLP-1 receptor agonists work by activating the GLP-1 receptors,
causing an increase in insulin secretion, a decrease in glucagon secretion, slowing of gastric emptying, and
increasing satiety. DPP-4 inhibitors inhibit DPP-4 activity, which increases postprandial active incretin
concentration. This increases insulin secretion and decreases glucagon secretion. Meglitinides act by
closing the ATP-sensitive K+ channels on the B-cell plasma membranes, which increases insulin secretion.
"-Glucosidase inhibitors inhibit intestinal "-glucosidase, which slows intestinal carbohydrate digestion and
absorption.
