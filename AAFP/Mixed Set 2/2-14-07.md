Amitriptyline

First-line treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, according to the American Diabetes Association, is tricyclic antidepressants. Anticonvulsants are second line and opioids are third line. Many medications have been found to be effective, including the tricyclics, duloxetine, pregabalin, oxycodone, and tramadol (SOR A).
Among the tricyclics, amitriptyline, imipramine, and nortriptyline have been found to be the most effective (SOR A). For an uninsured patient, the tricyclics are also the most affordable.
