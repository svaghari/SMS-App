A hematoma within the abdominal wall musculature

A reduction of the pain caused by abdominal palpation when the abdominal muscles are tightened is known as Carnettâ€™s sign. If the cause of the pain is visceral, the taut abdominal muscles may protect the locus of pain. In contrast, intensification of pain with this maneuver points to a source of pain within the abdominal wall itself.
