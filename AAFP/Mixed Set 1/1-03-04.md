Vitamin B12 deficiency

This patient has polyneuropathy, macrocytic anemia, and a history of chronic proton pump inhibitor use. The most likely cause is vitamin B12 deficiency and a serum level is indicated. Her hemoglobin A1c is 5.8%, which puts her at risk of developing diabetes mellitus but is not indicative of diabetes. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a rare cause of polyneuropathy and unlikely in this case. Hypothyroidism, and not hyperthyroidism, is associated with polyneuropathy. Tarsal tunnel syndrome causes a mononeuropathy.
