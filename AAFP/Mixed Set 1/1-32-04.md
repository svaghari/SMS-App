Exercise-based physical therapy

Exercise-based therapy is the foundation for treating knee osteoarthritis. Foot orthoses can be helpful for anterior knee pain but this patientâ€™s pain is located medially. The benefit of hyaluronic acid injections is controversial, and recommendations vary; recent systematic reviews do not support a clinically significant benefit. Weight loss is recommended for patients with a BMI >25.0 kg/m2. Wearing a knee brace has shown little or no benefit for reducing pain or improving knee function.
