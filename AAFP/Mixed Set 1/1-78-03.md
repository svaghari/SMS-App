a semi-rigid stirrup brace (Air-Stirrup, “Aircast”)

In acute ankle sprains, functional treatment with a semi-rigid brace that allows flexion and extension,  or a soft lace-up brace is recommended over immobilization.  Casting or posterior splinting is no longer recommended.  Elastic bandaging does not offer the same lateral and medial support.  External ankle support has been shown to improve proprioception.
