Discontinuing cephalexin

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is currently defined as either a rise in serum creatinine or a reduction in urine output. Creatinine must increase by at least 0.3 mg/dL, or to 50% above baseline within a 24–48 hour period. A reduction in urine output to 0.5 mL/kg/hr for longer than 6 hours also meets the criteria. Acute interstitial nephritis is an intrinsic renal cause of AKI. These patients are often nonoliguric. A history of recent medication use is key to the diagnosis, as cephalosporins and penicillin analogues are the most common causes. Approximately one-third of patients present with a maculopapular rash, fever, and arthralgias. Eosinophilia and sterile pyuria may also be seen in addition to eosinophiluria. Discontinuation of the offending drug is the cornerstone of management.

Although up to 30% of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection have some kidney involvement, acute interstitial nephritis is uncommon. Measuring postvoid residual urine volume is indicated if an obstructive cause for the AKI is suspected. Starting an antibiotic to cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is not indicated.
