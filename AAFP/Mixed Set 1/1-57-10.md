Diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking are significant risk factors for intermittent claudication, as are hypertension and dyslipidemia. Hyperthyroidism, hypercalcemia, and hypogonadism are not closely associated with intermittent claudication. Elevation of angiotensin-converting enzyme occurs with sarcoidosis.
