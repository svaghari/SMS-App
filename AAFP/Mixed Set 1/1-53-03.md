Continue enoxaparin upon discharge

Enoxaparin and other low molecular weight heparins are effective and are the preferred agents for acute and long-term anticoagulation in patients with an active malignancy (SOR B). Warfarin has been shown to be less effective in cancer patients and is not recommended to treat venous thromboembolic disease in this setting (SOR B). The novel oral anticoagulants including rivaroxaban have not been studied in the setting of malignancy and are not recommended.
