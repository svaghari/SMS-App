Maintaining a regular sleep/wake schedule

Maintaining a regular sleep/wake schedule helps prevent insomnia. While a light snack before bed may be sleep inducing, heavy meals close to bedtime may be counterproductive. Alcohol should be avoided as a sedative, to prevent midsleep awakenings. Hours spent reading or watching television in bed can lead to long awakenings in the middle of the night.
