Order an urgent MRI

Malignant epidural spinal cord compression is an oncologic emergency that requires urgent MRI to confirm
the diagnosis. It is caused by a tumor compressing the dural sac and should be suspected with new-onset
progressive back pain that is worse when the patient is lying down. It is most commonly associated with
breast cancer and develops in approximately 5% of all patients with cancer. Once the diagnosis is
confirmed, an urgent management approach is needed. Corticosteroids and neurosurgical intervention can
preserve motor and sensory function. Attempting to alleviate the pain would not address this emergency.
