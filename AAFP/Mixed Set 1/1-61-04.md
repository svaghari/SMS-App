Valacyclovir (Valtrex)

This patient has a recurrent outbreak of genital herpes, and valacyclovir is the preferred treatment. Penicillin G benzathine is a treatment for syphilis, which usually begins as a painless papule that transforms into the classic chancre. Fluconazole and metronidazole are treatments for yeast vaginitis and bacterial vaginitis; these conditions present with itching and a vaginal discharge but not vesicular lesions. Doxycycline is a treatment for Chlamydia infection, which is often completely asymptomatic and detected only with screening.
