Upper and lower endoscopy

This patient’s age, risk factors, red-flag symptoms, and other clinical findings indicate the need for endoscopy. The Leser-Trélat sign may be defined as the abrupt onset of multiple seborrheic keratoses, which is an unusual finding that often indicates an underlying malignancy, most commonly an adenocarcinoma of the stomach. CT is not an initial approach for diagnosing a suspected malignancy of the stomach or colon. Further skin evaluation and lifestyle changes, which are indicated, will not address the need for evaluation of weight loss and other abnormal symptoms and findings.
