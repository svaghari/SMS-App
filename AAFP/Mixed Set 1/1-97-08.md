Increases the risk for instrument-assisted vaginal delivery

Regional analgesia in laboring patients increases the risk of vacuum-or forceps-assisted delivery (relative risk = 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.28â€“1.57; 23 trials; n = 735). Multiple randomized, controlled trials have compared regional analgesia with no analgesia. In a meta-analysis, no statistically significant impact was found on the risk of cesarean delivery, maternal satisfaction with pain relief, long-term backache, or immediate effect on neonatal status as determined by Apgar scores. Regional analgesia provides better pain relief than opioid analgesia.
