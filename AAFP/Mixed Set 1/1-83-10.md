No additional drug therapy

Behavioral symptoms such as agitation and wandering become common as Alzheimer’s disease progresses. Cholinesterase inhibitors may improve some of these symptoms. If they persist, use of a psychotropic agent may be necessary. Atypical agents can help control problematic delusions, hallucinations, severe psychomotor agitation, and combativeness. Typical agents help control these same problems, but are used more as second-line therapy in those who do not respond to atypical agents. Mood-stabilizing drugs can help control these symptoms as well, and may also be useful alternatives to antipsychotic agents for controlling severe agitated, repetitive, and combative behaviors. Benzodiazepines are used to manage insomnia, anxiety and agitation. Some behaviors, such as wandering and pacing, are not amenable to drug therapy.
