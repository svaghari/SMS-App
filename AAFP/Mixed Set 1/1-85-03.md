Immobilize in a thumb spica splint for 1â€“2 weeks and then order repeat radiographs

Snuffbox tenderness and tenderness over the scaphoid tubercle are very sensitive for fracture of the scaphoid, but their specificity is only 40% and 60% respectively. Therefore, while the lack of tenderness at these sites almost rules out fracture, further imaging is needed in positive cases. Plain films are recommended as the next step. A bone scan or follow-up films after immobilization for 2 weeks should be done if the initial films are negative. Bone scans may be negative until enough time has passed for osteoblastic activity to begin. Ultrasonography is not helpful for evaluation of scaphoid fractures.
