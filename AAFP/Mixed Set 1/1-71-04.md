Intravenous vancomycin

This patient has systemic symptoms that suggest a severe underlying infection. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) should be considered the cause of this type of infection until definitive cultures are obtained. CA-MRSA can cause aggressive infections in children, especially in the skin and soft tissue. Incision and drainage of the abscess is necessary for treatment. In a severe infection, vancomycin should be started initially until culture and sensitivities are available (SORB).
