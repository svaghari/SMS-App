repeat ultrasonography in 6-12 months

This is a classic incidentaloma.  Nodules are detected in up to 50% of thyroid sonograms and carry a low risk of malignancy (<5%).  If the TSH level is normal, nuclear scanning and further thyroid studies are not necessary.  Nodules smaller than 1 cm are difficult to biopsy and thyroid surgery is not indicated for what is almost certainly benign disease.  It is reasonable to follow small nodules with clinical examinations and periodic sonograms. Ref: Hegedus L: The thyroid nodule. N Engl J Med 2004;351(17):1764-1771.
