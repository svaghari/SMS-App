Strict handwashing practices by all staff, visitors, and residents

All staff, visitors, and nursing home residents should observe strict handwashing practices when a resident has a MRSA infection. Barrier precautions for wounds and medical devices should also be initiated. Surveillance cultures are not warranted. Aggressive housekeeping practices play little, if any, role in preventing the spread of MRSA. Isolating the patient is not practical or cost effective.
