A serum fructosamine level

This patient with sickle cell disease has a new onset of diabetes mellitus. Hemoglobinopathies falsely lower
hemoglobin A1c as a result of hemolysis and abnormal glycation. Fructosamine correlates well with
hemoglobin A1c levels and is recommended instead of hemoglobin A1c for monitoring glucose control in
patients with diabetes and hemoglobinopathies. A 2-hour glucose tolerance test or hemoglobin
electrophoresis would not provide useful information. Referral to an endocrinologist is not indicated at this
point because the patient has not failed primary care management.
