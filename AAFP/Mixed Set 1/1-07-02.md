A luteal-phase progesterone level

Although infertility issues may be very complex, the primary care physician can initiate an appropriate
workup. For women who are having regular menstrual cycles, ovulation is very likely. Ovulation can be
confirmed by a progesterone level Â³5 ng/mL on day 21 of the cycle. If this is the case, tubal patency
should be confirmed with hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy. Obstruction or adhesions would require
surgical correction, but if there are none, referral for assisted reproductive technology would be
appropriate.

Should the progesterone level be <5 ng/mL, anovulation should be investigated with TSH, estradiol, FSH,
and prolactin levels. Treatment can be initiated if findings reveal the cause of the problem, but if they are
unremarkable it is reasonable to try clomiphene to induce ovulation. If this is unsuccessful, referral would
be the next step.
