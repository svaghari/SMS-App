Intravenous drug use

A young man with weight loss, oral thrush, lymphadenopathy, and ulcerative esophagitis is likely to have HIV infection. Intravenous drug use is responsible for over a quarter of HIV infections in the United States. Esophageal disease develops in more than half of all patients with advanced infection during the course of their illness. The most common pathogens causing esophageal ulceration in HIV-positive patients include Candida, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus. Identifying the causative agent through culture or tissue sampling is important for providing prompt and specific therapy.
