Spironolactone (Aldactone)

Diuretics lessen the severity of obstructive sleep apnea and reduce blood pressure. Aldosterone antagonists offer further benefit beyond that of traditional diuretics. Resistant hypertension is common in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Resistant hypertension is also associated with higher levels of aldosterone, which can lead to secondary pharyngeal edema, increasing upper airway obstruction.
