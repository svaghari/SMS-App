Serum protein electrophoresis

This patient’s laboratory results and back pain suggest multiple myeloma (MM). He has a normocytic
anemia and evidence of renal insufficiency, which can indicate MM. The laboratory findings along with
worsening back pain indicate a need to order serum protein electrophoresis to look for MM. Flow
cytometry is generally used in patients with an elevated WBC count and suspected lymphoma. The
remainder of this patient’s CBC is normal, which makes a bone marrow issue less likely. His mean
corpuscular volume is also normal, making vitamin B12 deficiency less likely. A haptoglobin level could
be ordered, but protein electrophoresis is a better choice because the peripheral smear demonstrated no
evidence of a hemolytic problem.
