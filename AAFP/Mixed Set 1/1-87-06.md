Patients unresponsive after 6 weeks should have their treatment altered

An adequate trial of antidepressant therapy is 4â€“6 weeks. Patients who are unresponsive to treatment may respond to another antidepressant with a different mechanism of action. Patients who are partially responsive may benefit from dosage titration or the addition of a second antidepressant in combination. Electroconvulsive therapy is the most effective treatment in patients with severe resistance to medical antidepressant therapy or those with psychotic depression.
