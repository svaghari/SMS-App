Citalopram (Celexa)

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms improve with several different medications and alternative therapies. Exercise, probiotics, antibiotics, antispasmodics, antidepressants, psychological treatments, and peppermint oil all have evidence that they may improve IBS symptoms (SOR B). A Cochrane review of 15 studies involving 922 patients found a beneficial effect from antidepressants with regard to improvement in pain and overall symptom scores compared to placebo. SSRIs used in these trials included citalopram, fluoxetine, and paroxetine, and tricyclic antidepressants included amitriptyline, desipramine, and imipramine. Buspirone, clonazepam, divalproex sodium, and risperidone have not been shown to be effective for symptom relief in IBS patients.
