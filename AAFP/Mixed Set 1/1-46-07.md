Supplemental oxygen

The only proven therapy for pulmonary hypertension related to COPD is supplemental oxygen. Supplemental oxygen should be recommended when the PaO2 is <60 mm Hg, because it has been shown to improve mortality by lowering pulmonary arterial pressures. Treatments effective for pulmonary artery hypertension should not be used. Pulmonary vasodilators such as nifedipine, sildenafil, and bosentan may cause a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Pulmonary endarterectomy may be indicated for pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic thromboembolic disease.
