 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)

Recent clinical experience has shown that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the most
common identifiable cause of skin and soft-tissue infections among patients presenting to emergency
departments in 11 U.S. cities. The other responses should be considered in evaluating these infections,
but they are not as common as MRSA infections.
