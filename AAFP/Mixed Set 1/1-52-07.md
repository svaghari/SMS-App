This patient presents with chronic olecranon bursitis. The diagnosis can be made based on his history and the physical examination. No other testing is indicated at this time. Chronic bursitis is due to repetitive microtrauma. The olecranon is the most common location for chronic bursitis. Patients typically have no history of injury, minimal pain, no systemic symptoms, and no signs of acute infection or inflammation. Treatment initially consists of avoiding recurrent trauma by protecting the area (elbow pad), not leaning on it, ice, compression, and over-the-counter analgesics. If the lesion is inflamed or appears septic then laboratory testing should be performed, including a CBC with differential, a glucose level, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a C-reactive protein level. Joint aspiration and/or ultrasonography may be indicated if the diagnosis is not apparent. A plain radiograph would be indicated to rule out a fracture in a patient with traumatic bursitis.
