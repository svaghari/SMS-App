Avoiding the use of gadolinium contrast

The use of gadolinium contrast has been associated with acute kidney injury and also with the development of nephrogenic systemic sclerosis in patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease. Because of these risks, the FDA recommends avoiding gadolinium contrast in patients with a glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, as well as in patients with acute renal failure. The risk of nephrogenic systemic sclerosis is not affected by blood pressure, medications, intravenous hydration, or pretreatment with n-acetylcysteine.
