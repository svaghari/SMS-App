Urine testing for Legionella pneumophila antigen

A urine test for Legionella pneumophila antigen is the preferred method to confirm Legionnaires’ disease. This test is rapid and will only detect Legionella pneumophila antigen. A sputum culture is the gold standard for the diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease but it requires 48–72 hours. A chest radiograph does not confirm the diagnosis but may show the extent of disease. Responding to antibiotic treatment does not confirm a specific diagnosis.
