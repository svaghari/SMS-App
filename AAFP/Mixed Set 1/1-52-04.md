Shaving with electric clippers

This patient has pseudofolliculitis barbae, which is a common condition affecting the face and neck in people with tightly curled hair. The condition occurs when hairs are cut at an angle and curl in on themselves, creating a foreign body reaction. The condition may progress to scarring and keloid formation. Cessation of hair removal improves the condition. If this is not desired, less aggressive hair trimming is recommended. Clippers generally result in a less close shave and contribute less to pseudofolliculitis barbae. Multi-blade razors, pulling the skin taut, and plucking hairs all result in shorter hair and are likely to exacerbate the problem. The description of the rash is not consistent with secondary infection, so oral cephalexin would not be indicated at this time. Treatment is similar to the treatment of acne, with benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, and topical antibiotics having a role, along with topical corticosteroids.
