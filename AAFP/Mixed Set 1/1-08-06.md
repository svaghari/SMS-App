A chest radiograph

The first step in the evaluation of nonmassive hemoptysis is to obtain a chest radiograph. If this is normal
and there is a high risk of malignancy (patient age 40 years or older with at least a 30-pack year smoking
history), chest CT should be ordered. Bronchoscopy should also be considered in the workup of high-risk
patients. If a chest radiograph shows an infiltrate, treatment with antibiotics is warranted. If the chest
radiograph is normal the patient is at low risk for malignancy, and if the history does not suggest lower
respiratory infection and hemoptysis does not recur, observation can be considered.
