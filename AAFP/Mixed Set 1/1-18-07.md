Aspirin, 81 mg daily

For women at high risk of developing preeclampsia, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
recommends starting low-dose aspirin after 12 weeks gestation (B recommendation). While calcium
appears to be helpful in preventing preeclampsia for women with a diet deficient in calcium, the evidence
is not yet conclusive. The USPSTF recommendation does not address the use of fish oil, magnesium
gluconate, vitamin C, or vitamin D for the prevention of preeclampsia.
