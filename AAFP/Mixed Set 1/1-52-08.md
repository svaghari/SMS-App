Subcutaneous enoxaparin (Lovenox)

Enoxaparin is the most appropriate pharmacologic therapy for anticoagulation in patients who are pregnant. Aspirin is not used as treatment for deep vein thrombosis. Apixaban, warfarin, and heparin either have not been studied for use in pregnancy or there is data indicating potential fetal harm.
