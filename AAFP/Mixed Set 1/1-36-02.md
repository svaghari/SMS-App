Providing oral amoxicillin or levofloxacin (Levaquin) for initial empiric treatment of a fever if he is unable to obtain medical care within a few hours

Amoxicillin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin should be taken by asplenic patients with a new onset of fever if they cannot get to a medical facility within 2 hours for evaluation. Fever should be reported immediately due to the lifelong significant risk of sepsis. Unless otherwise contraindicated, asplenic patients should receive annual influenza immunization. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) should be given twice, with the second dose given 5 years after the first.
