Screening for depression

Screening for postpartum depression is recommended as part of the routine postpartum visit. The use of a screening tool for depression is recommended, such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This scale has been shown to increase the identification of women at high risk for depression. A CBC or urine dipstick is recommended only for patients who have an indication for them, and should not be routinely ordered. Thyroid function tests and glucose tolerance testing are recommended for patients who are either symptomatic or at high risk for disease.
