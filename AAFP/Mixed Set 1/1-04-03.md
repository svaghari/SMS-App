DXA scan

This patient has subclinical hyperthyroidism as evidenced by her low TSH level with normal free T4 and free T3 levels. Common causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism include Graves disease, autonomous functioning thyroid adenoma, and multinodular toxic goiter. Subclinical hyperthyroidism may progress to overt hyperthyroidism; this is more likely in patients with TSH levels <0.1 μU/mL. Even in the absence of overt hyperthyroidism these patients are at higher risk for several health conditions, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and osteoporosis. For this reason it is important to assess for these conditions and consider treating the underlying thyroid condition, as well as the complication. The American Thyroid Association recommends treating patients with complications who are either over age 65 or have a TSH level <0.1 μU/mL.

Lipid and glucose abnormalities are not known to be related to subclinical hyperthyroidism. Calcium levels may be abnormal in hyperparathyroidism but not hyperthyroidism. Thyroid ultrasonography may be helpful to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism but is not used to help decide when to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism.
