Another physician involved in the patient’s care requests information

HIPAA legislation states that a patient’s personal medical and financial information cannot be released
unless the patient authorizes such a release in writing. The exceptions to this standard are the following:
(1) coordination of care between providers and those involved in the patient’s case (i.e., caretakers, nurses, consulting physicians); (2) arranging payment for medical services rendered; and (3) health-care operations such as evaluating a provider or system’s competency or quality. The privacy rule allows some discretion to a physician in “coordinating care,” even allowing a physician to speak with family members if that physician “in his or her professional judgment” feels it is in the patient’s best interest. In such situations
it is advisable to ask the patient’s permission to do so if possible, and the information should be related on
a need-to-know basis.
