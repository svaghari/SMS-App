Morphine

Morphine effectively decreases the feeling of shortness of breath in hospice patients. Randomized, controlled trials have shown significant improvements in symptoms without a significant change in oxygen saturation. Haloperidol can be used for nausea and vomiting (SOR B) and delirium, but is not helpful in the treatment of shortness of breath. Scopolamine is used to decrease the production of secretions but is not helpful for treating dyspnea. Corticosteroids will not manage the sensation of shortness of breath in a dying patient.
