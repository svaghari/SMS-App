Sertraline (Zoloft)

Somatic symptom disorders account for approximately 5% of primary care visits. Effective pharmacologic
treatment includes sertraline and other SSRI-based therapy in addition to cognitive-behavioral therapy
(SOR B). Bupropion, monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as selegiline, anticonvulsants such as topiramate,
and antipsychotics such as clozapine are ineffective.
