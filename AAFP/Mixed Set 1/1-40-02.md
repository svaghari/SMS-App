community-acquired pneumonia

This patient has pneumonia based on the clinical presentation and the physical findings of fever, cough, and abnormal lung findings. A fever would not be a typical finding in pulmonary embolus or heart failure. An upper respiratory infection is unlikely given the abnormal lung findings that suggest a lower respiratory tract infection. This would not be a typical presentation for acute leukemia.
