Administration of both HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine now

Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) should be administered as soon as possible to patients with known exposure to hepatitis B. Hepatitis B vaccine is a killed-virus vaccine and can be used safely in pregnancy, with no need to wait until after organogenesis. This patient has been exposed to sexual transmission for at least 6 weeks, given that the incubation period is at least that long, so it is too late to use condoms to prevent infection. The patient is unlikely to be previously immune to hepatitis B, given that she has no history of hepatitis B infection, immunization, or carriage. Because the patient's HBsAg is negative, she is not the source of her husband's infection. Full treatment for this patient has an efficacy of only 75% so follow-up testing is still needed.
