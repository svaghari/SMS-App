Loperamide (Imodium)

This patient has classic symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and meets the Rome criteria by having 3 days per month of abdominal pain for the past 3 months, a change in the frequency of stool, and improvement with defecation.  According to current clinical guidelines IBS can be diagnosed by history, physical examination, and routine laboratory testing, as long as there are no warning signs.  Warning signs include rectal bleeding, anemia, weight loss, fever, a family history of colon cancer, onset of symptoms after age 50, and a major change in symptoms.  Colonoscopy, CT, and GI contrast studies are not indicated.  A gluten-free diet would not be indicated since the antibody tests for celiac disease are negative.  Antidiarrheal agents such as loperamide are generally safe and effective in the management of diarrheal symptoms in IBS. Ref: Mayer EA: Irritable bowel syndrome. N Engl J Med 2008;358(16):1692-1699.
