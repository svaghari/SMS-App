Supervised exercise

The goals of osteoarthritis therapy are to minimize pain and improve function. The American Academy
of Orthopedic Surgery and the American College of Rheumatology have agreed that first-line treatment
includes aerobic exercise, resistance training, and weight loss. For patients with osteoarthritis of the knee,
supervised exercise was found to reduce pain and improve physical function and quality of life (SOR A).
Vitamin D is not currently recommended, and glucosamine and chondroitin are less effective than placebo.
Initial pharmacotherapy includes full-strength acetaminophen, or oral or topical NSAIDs. If patients have
an inadequate response to these agents other treatments to consider include tramadol, other opioids,
duloxetine, or intra-articular injections with corticosteroids or hyaluronate.
