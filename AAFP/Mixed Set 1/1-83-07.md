Stress fracture of the right femoral neck

Stress fractures of the femoral neck are most commonly seen in military recruits and runners. They present with persistent groin pain, and limited hip flexion and internal rotation. Radiographs may be normal early. Iliotibial band syndrome also occurs in runners and presents with stinging pain over the lateral femoral epicondyle. Osteitis pubis occurs in distance runners and presents with pain in the anterior pelvic area and tenderness over the symphysis pubis. Pelvic inflammatory disease is associated with abdominal pain and fever. Ref: Martin TM, Martin JS: Special issues and concerns for high school and college athletes.
