Doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 10 days

This is a classic description of rickettsial illness (in the United States this would most likely be Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever):  a history of outdoor activity, the sudden onset of fever, chills, and rash on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.  Penicillin, cephalexin, and azithromycin do not cover rickettsia.  Reassurance would be inappropriate because this condition can be life threatening and should always be treated.
