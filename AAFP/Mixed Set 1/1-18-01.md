Methylprednisolone (Medrol)

This patient has severe community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical criteria, including an elevated
respiratory rate, confusion, and hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation. Corticosteroids such
as methylprednisolone have been shown to improve clinical outcomes such as length of stay, duration of
antibiotic treatment, and the risk of developing adult respiratory distress syndrome. The preferred choice
of antibiotic treatment for patients in the intensive-care unit is a -lactam antibiotic (ceftriaxone,
cefotaxime) or ampicillin/sulbactam, plus a macrolide alone or a macrolide and a respiratory
fluoroquinolone. The addition of levofloxacin is not necessarily preferred over just ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. Clindamycin is not indicated in the absence of risk factors for anaerobic infection such as
aspiration or alcoholism. Oseltamivir is not indicated in the absence of known or suspected influenza
infection.
