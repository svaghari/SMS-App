akathisia

Motor side effects of the antipsychotic drugs can be separated into five general categories: dystonias, parkinsonism, akathisia, withdrawal dyskinesias, and tardive dyskinesia. Akathisia is a syndrome marked by motor restlessness. Affected patients commonly complain of being inexplicably anxious, of being unable to sit still or concentrate, and of feeling comfortable only when moving. A diagnosis of hysteria is inconsistent with the findings presented.
