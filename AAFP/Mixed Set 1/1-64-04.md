Physical therapy

This patient has patellofemoral stress syndrome. It is often called runner's knee or anterior knee pain. The patellofemoral joint comprises the patella and femoral trochlea. The best initial treatment is physical therapy. Bracing, taping, and medications are unlikely to have better outcomes. Arthroscopic surgery is not indicated.
