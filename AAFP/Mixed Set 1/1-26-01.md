Helicobacter pylori gastritis

Absorption of levothyroxine is impaired by several gastrointestinal conditions, including atrophic gastritis, chronic proton pump inhibitor use, and Helicobacter pylori infection. Treatment of H. pylori infection reverses this effect, and following eradication of the infection a reduction of the levothyroxine dosage by 30% or more will often be required.
