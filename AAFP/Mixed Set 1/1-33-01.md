a spot urine protein to creatinine ratio

This patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and presents with new-onset edema in her lower
extremities, the most common presenting symptom of nephrotic syndrome (NS). Patients
with NS may also report foamy urine, exertional dyspnea or fatigue, and significant
fluid-associated weight gain. A 24-hour urine collection for protein (not creatinine) can be
used to diagnose proteinuria, but the collection process is cumbersome and the specimen
is often collected incorrectly. The protein-to-creatinine ratio from a single urine sample is
commonly used to diagnose nephrotic-range proteinuria. The role of a renal biopsy in
patients with NS is controversial and there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding
indications for a biopsy. Renal ultrasonography may be appropriate to assess for underlying
conditions and/or disease complications if the glomerular filtration rate is reduced. There
is no data to support using MRI in the diagnosis and management of nephrotic syndrome.
