Obtain a radiograph and give prophylactic antibiotics

This presentation is consistent with a common injury called a “fight bite.” Radiographs are needed to determine if there is a distal metacarpal fracture so that it can be treated appropriately. Because human bites commonly cause infection, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended with any break in the skin. If the skin break is superficial, this is sufficient. Deeper wounds should be explored by a surgeon, but superficial wounds should not be probed indiscriminately. Ref: Daniels J, Zook E, Lynch J: Hand and wrist injuries: Part II. Emergent evaluation.
