azithromycin (Zithromax)

Community-acquired pneumonia in children is treated based on age. The most likely etiologic agents in a school-age child are Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydia pneumoniae , and Streptococcus pneumoniae . Group A Streptococcus and Haemophilus influenzae are less common causes. Staphylococcus aureus that is methicillin-resistant has become increasingly common. The preferred treatment for community-acquired pneumonia is a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin.
In children ages 5â€“16, Mycoplasma pneumonia tends to have a gradual onset of symptoms and seldom causes respiratory distress. Signs and symptoms may vary. The patient may develop a rash, musculoskeletal symptoms, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Radiographs may reveal bronchopneumonia, nodular infiltrates, hilar adenopathy, pleural effusions, or plate-like atelectasis. Ear pain may be due to bullous myringitis, although this may be viral as well. Laboratory findings may not be helpful, as the WBC count may be normal or slightly elevated. There may be thrombocytosis, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an elevation of cold agglutinins, or an elevated reticulocyte count. A Coombs test is seldom needed, although it might be helpful at times. The diagnosis is generally made on a clinical basis.
