A 35-year-old female with a history of infectious endocarditis in her 20s that was related to intravenous drug use

The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have decreased the number of indications for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures. Currently antibiotics are indicated for prosthetic cardiac valves, previous infective endocarditis, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease or a repaired congenital defect with a residual shunt, and a cardiac transplant with valve regurgitation due to a structurally abnormal valve. Amoxicillin, 2 g, is the antibiotic prophylaxis of choice.
