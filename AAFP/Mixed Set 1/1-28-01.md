Methimazole (Tapazole)

Based on her clinical presentation and classic ophthalmopathy, this patient has Graves disease. Unlike radioactive iodine, methimazole has been shown to decrease the risk of development or progression of ophthalmopathy in Graves disease (SOR B). Atenolol is used for symptomatic control in hyperthyroidism. Cholestyramine can help lower thyroid hormone acutely but is not a long-term treatment. Prednisone is used for severe hyperthyroidism and not long-term treatment. Atenolol, cholestyramine, and prednisone do not have any effect on the long-term complications of Graves disease.
