Use of a validated screening tool to evaluate for postpartum depression

While it is possible that this patient has baby blues, given the short duration of symptoms proximate to delivery, more evaluation is needed to differentiate between baby blues, which are very common and unlikely to contribute to the development of postpartum depression, and an episode of postpartum depression that has much more significant implications. There is more than one screening tool for postpartum depression, including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the PHQ-9 questionnaire, and the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale. An SSRI is the appropriate treatment for confirmed moderate to severe postpartum depression along with psychotherapy, while mild to moderate postpartum depression can be treated with psychotherapy or an SSRI. Referral to psychotherapy may be appropriate, but further evaluation should be pursued in order to determine the best treatment plan. Due to the risks associated with postpartum depression, an evaluation should be performed at this visit rather than asking the patient to monitor symptoms.
