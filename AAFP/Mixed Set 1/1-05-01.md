affect her sleep

Palpitations are a common symptom in ambulatory care. Cardiac causes are the most worrisome so it is important to distinguish cardiac from noncardiac causes. Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, palpitations that affect their sleep, or palpitations that occur at work have an increased risk of an underlying cardiac cause (positive likelihood ratio 2.0â€“2.3) (SOR C). Psychiatric illness, adverse effects of medications, and substance abuse are other common causes.

Palpitations that are worse in public places and those of very short duration (<5 minutes), especially if there is a history of anxiety, are often related to panic disorder. However, even a known behavioral issue should not be presumed to be the cause of palpitations, as nonpsychiatric causes are found in up to 13% of such cases. The use of illicit substances such as cocaine and methamphetamine can cause palpitations that are associated with dry mouth, pupillary dilation, sweating, and aberrant behavior. Excessive caffeine can also cause palpitations.
