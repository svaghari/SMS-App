hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common type of cardiomyopathy, with a prevalence of 1:500. It involves left ventricular hypertrophy without chamber dilatation. It is caused by autosomal dominant genetic mutations and is associated with sudden death. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of heart failure but most patients are symptomatic. Peripartum cardiomyopathy may occur during and after pregnancy and presents as heart failure. Restrictive cardiomyopathy presents with right-sided heart failure.
