A sleep study

This patient has pulmonary hypertension that, based on her history, is most likely related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Most patients with pulmonary hypertension have an underlying disease of the heart or lungs that leads to elevated pulmonary artery pressures. Common underlying conditions include chronic lung disease such as COPD, OSA, and left heart failure (with a reduced or preserved ejection fraction). Additional considerations include chronic thromboembolic disease and primary pulmonary arterial hypertension.

This patientâ€™s obesity and unrefreshing sleep make OSA the likely underlying cause of her pulmonary hypertension. She does not have clinical features of thromboembolic disease or a history of COPD. Her echocardiogram does not show heart failure, and she has no symptoms to suggest obstructive coronary disease. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can aid in the diagnosis and optimal treatment of hypertension, but this would be unlikely to relate directly to her pulmonary hypertension.
