PA and lateral chest films

PA and lateral chest radiographs are still valuable in the early evaluation of patients with chest pain. While they do not confirm or rule out the presence of myocardial ischemia, other causes of chest pain may be evident, such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, or heart failure. The chest film may also provide clues about other possible diagnoses, such as pulmonary embolism, aortic disease, or neoplasia. The other tests listed often have a role in the evaluation of chest pain, but none has supplanted the plain chest film as the best initial imaging study.
