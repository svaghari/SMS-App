Intramuscular prochlorperazine

Multiple studies have determined that parenteral antiemetics have benefits for the treatment of acute
migraine beyond their effect on nausea. Most outpatient clinics do not have the ability to administer
intravenous metoclopramide, which is the preferred treatment. However, most clinics do have the ability
to administer intramuscular prochlorperazine or promethazine. Due to concerns about oversedation,
misuse, and rebound, treatment with parenteral opiates is discouraged but may be an option if other
treatments fail. Oral butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine and oral ergotamine/caffeine have less evidence of
success in the treatment of acute migraine. Sumatriptan is contraindicated within 24 hours of the use of
rizatriptan.
