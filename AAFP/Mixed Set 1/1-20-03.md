Eszopiclone (Lunesta)

Although behavioral interventions are the mainstay of treatment for insomnia, they often need to be supplemented by pharmacologic therapy. When both doxepin and extended-release melatonin fail to provide benefit, a member of the Z-drug class should be tried next. Among the Z-drugs only eszopiclone provides an early peak onset and a long half-life, with a 1-hour approximate time to peak and a 6-hour half-life. While zaleplon has an equally short time to peak of 1 hour, it also has a 1 hour half-life. Antihistamines, including diphenhydramine and doxylamine, as well as atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine, are not indicated unless used primarily to treat another condition.
