Upper endoscopy

This patient has risk factors and symptoms that suggest esophageal cancer. According to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, upper endoscopy with a biopsy of suspicious lesions is the recommended initial evaluation for symptoms of esophageal cancer (SOR C). Esophagography would be appropriate in patients unable to undergo endoscopy but would not be the preferred test. CT of the abdomen is not indicated in the initial evaluation for esophageal cancer but can be integrated with a PET scan for staging. Esophageal manometry is reserved for patients with dysphagia if upper endoscopy does not establish a diagnosis and a motility disorder is suspected. Increasing the dosage of the proton pump inhibitor would not be an appropriate treatment for this patientâ€™s condition and may delay the diagnosis and treatment of suspected cancer if the patient is not referred promptly for upper endoscopy.
