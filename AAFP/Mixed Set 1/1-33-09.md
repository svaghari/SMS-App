7.0%–7.9%

In patients ≥65 years of age treated with medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin A1c values of 7%–8% have shown the greatest reduction in mortality in multiple studies. It is suggested that frequent hypoglycemia is associated with lower hemoglobin A1c values, and that presents a greater risk. Values over 9% are associated with greater mortality (SOR B). Thus, while the risk of complications increases linearly with hemoglobin A1c, mortality has a V-shaped curve.
