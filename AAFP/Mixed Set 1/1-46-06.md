1 hour after it was given

Most orally administered immediate-release opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone reach their peak effect at about 1 hour, at which time additional medication can be given if the patient is still in pain. Intravenous opioids reach their peak effect at about 10 minutes and intramuscular and subcutaneous opioids at about 20â€“30 minutes. Additional medication may therefore be given at those intervals if additional pain relief is required.
