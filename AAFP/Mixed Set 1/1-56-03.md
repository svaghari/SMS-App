clopidogrel

Patients with drug-eluting stents should be on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a thienopyridine such as clopidogrel for a minimum of 1 year. At the time of this patient’s visit, 2 years after the stent placement, there is no indication to continue clopidogrel, but aspirin therapy should be continued indefinitely. All of the patient’s other medications have current active indications and should be continued, although if the patient experiences hypoglycemia, the sulfonylurea could be decreased or discontinued.
