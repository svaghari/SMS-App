the tinnitus is unilateral

Tinnitus that is bilateral and not bothersome can be treated conservatively with cognitive-behavioral therapy, sound therapy, and, if appropriate, hearing aids. Antidepressants are not recommended. Pulsatile tinnitus, unilateral tinnitus, or tinnitus associated with asymmetric hearing loss is more likely to be associated with a pathologic cause. Symmetric, mild, high-frequency hearing loss is common in elderly patients. Imaging should not be part of the routine management of tinnitus that does not have warning signs, and patients should be counseled on conservative measures as described.
