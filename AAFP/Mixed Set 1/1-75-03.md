In patients with renal failure, the risk for death and serious cardiovascular events is increased with higher hemoglobin levels (â‰¥13.5 g/dL), and it is therefore recommended that levels be maintained at 10-12 g/dL.  Studies have also demonstrated less mortality and morbidity when the dosage of epoetin alfa is set to achieve a target hemoglobin of <12 g/dL.
