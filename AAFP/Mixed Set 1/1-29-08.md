A repeat fasting plasma glucose level in 1–2 weeks

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose levels as part of a cardiovascular disease risk assessment for adults who are 40–70 years of age and who are overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9 kg/m²) or obese (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m²). Since his fasting blood glucose result was in the range consistent with impaired fasting glucose (100–125 mg/dL), the USPSTF recommends confirming the diagnosis of the abnormal glucose level soon by performing the same test on a different day. Appropriate treatment should begin once the diagnosis is confirmed.
