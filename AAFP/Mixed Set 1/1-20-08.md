A serum ferritin level

Anemia is often diagnosed incidentally on laboratory testing and is often asymptomatic. It is associated
with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults, and is often caused by nutritional deficiencies,
chronic kidney disease, occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancies, or chronic inflammation.
However, in many patients the cause remains unknown. A detailed history and physical examination are
indicated. In patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia, a serum ferritin level should be ordered. A
low serum ferritin level is associated with iron deficiency and should be further evaluated so the underlying
cause can be addressed. A serum transferrin-receptorâ€“ferritin index should be determined for patients with
a serum ferritin level between 46 and 100 ng/mL to distinguish between iron deficiency anemia and other
types of anemia. Referring this patient to a gastroenterologist would not be indicated at this time.
