No diagnostic studies at this time

This patient had a classic simple febrile seizure and no additional diagnostic studies are recommended.  A lumbar puncture following a seizure is not routinely recommended in a child over 18 months of age, since by that age a patient with meningitis would be expected to demonstrate meningeal signs and symptoms or clinical findings suggesting an intracranial infection.  There is no evidence to suggest that routine blood tests or neuroimaging studies are useful in a patient following a first simple febrile seizure, and it has not been shown that electroencephalography performed either at the time of presentation or within the following month will predict the likelihood of recurrence.
