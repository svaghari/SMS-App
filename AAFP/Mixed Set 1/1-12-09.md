Aortic valve replacement

This patient has symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. The only treatment that improves this condition is
aortic valve replacement (SOR B). Transcutaneous aortic valve replacement may be an alternative for
patients who are not candidates for surgery. -Blockers must be used with caution due to the risk of
depressing left ventricular systolic function. They have not been shown to improve mortality. Antimicrobial
prophylaxis is not indicated unless a patient has undergone valve replacement or has a history of
endocarditis (SOR C). Atrial fibrillation is common in patients with aortic stenosis and rate control is
important. Symptomatic mitral valve regurgitation may require mitral valve intervention. However, these
murmurs are holosystolic, high pitched, and best heard at the cardiac apex. A ventricular septal defect can
cause a loud holosystolic murmur with an associated thrill heard best at the third/fourth interspace along
the sternal border.
