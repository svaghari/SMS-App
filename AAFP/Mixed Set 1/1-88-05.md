N-acetylcysteine

Current methods for reducing the risk of renal failure induced by contrast material include adequate hydration and the use of N-acetylcysteine. Neither mannitol nor furosemide has been shown to prevent contrast-induced renal failure. Corticosteroids and antihistamines are useful for the prevention of idiosyncratic reactions to contrast, but are not helpful in reducing the risk of renal failure.
