Tdap

Tdap is recommended for all women with each pregnancy, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks gestation. Live vaccines such as varicella and MMR are contraindicated during pregnancy. There is inadequate data to recommend vaccination against pneumococcal disease during pregnancy. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended during pregnancy only for women at high risk for infection.
