Magnetic resonance angiography of the renal arteries

In young adults diagnosed with secondary hypertension, evaluation for fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries with MR angiography or CT angiography is indicated (SOR C). The aldosterone/renin ratio is the most sensitive test to diagnose primary hyperaldosteronism. Renal ultrasonography is an indirect test that is not as sensitive or specific for fibromuscular dysplasia. Serum creatinine elevation shows renal involvement but does not identify the cause. Testing for metanephrines is indicated only if a pheochromocytoma is suspected.
