Bedbugs

This childâ€™s presentation appears most consistent with bites from an insect. Having multiple exposures on skin often not covered by clothing would be typical of household fleas or bedbugs. Tick bites are typically identified by the presence of an actively feeding insect or a single papular lesion. Similarly, brown recluse spider bites would not be expected to be multiple or recurrent. A chigger is the larval form of a mite, which is an eight-legged arthropod. The larval form has only six legs, and tends to crawl into spaces near constricted clothing and cause welts from their bites along the neckline, waistline, sock line, or more rarely on the genitals. A scabies infestation often presents as an eczematous rash in semiprotected folds of skin such as the web spaces of fingers, the umbilicus, the axillae, or the genital region.
