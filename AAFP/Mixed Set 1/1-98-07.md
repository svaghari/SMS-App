Transvaginal ultrasonography

Endometriosis is caused by menstrual tissue in the pelvic peritoneal cavity. Infertility, dysmenorrhea, and
dyspareunia with postcoital bleeding are common. Although laparoscopy with histology is the definitive
test, transvaginal ultrasonography is the noninvasive test of choice. CA-125 will often be elevated but is
nonspecific. CT and MRI also have low specificity, and colonoscopy is of no value in the evaluation of
endometriosis.
