Graves disease

Pretibial myxedema is a complication of Graves disease, whether it presents as hypo-or hyperthyroidism. It is a dermopathy that most often occurs in the lower legs and results from increased deposition of mucin due to the endocrine abnormality. Diabetes mellitus can cause necrobiosis lipoidica, a lesion on the lower extremities; hyperlipidemia can cause waxy papules; and collagen vascular and ischemic disease can cause urticaria and/or ulceration.
