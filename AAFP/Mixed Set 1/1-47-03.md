No antibiotics

This patient has asymptomatic bacteriuria and does not require antibiotic therapy at this time. In women age 70 and older the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is 16%–18%, and in chronically incontinent and disabled older adults rates may reach 43%. Symptoms that raise concern for a urinary tract infection (UTI) include acute dysuria, new or worsening urinary urgency or frequency, new incontinence, gross hematuria, and suprapubic or costovertebral angle tenderness. General malaise in the absence of these symptoms is unlikely to represent a UTI and unlikely to improve with antibiotic therapy.

When antibiotic therapy is indicated for a UTI, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole remains the first-line agent. Nitrofurantoin may be used for those with a creatinine clearance >40 mL/min/1.73 m2. Ciprofloxacin is recommended as a first-line agent only in communities with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance rates above 10%–20%. Fosfomycin may be used for more highly resistant organisms. The choice of antibiotic should be guided by bacterial pathogens if they are known.
