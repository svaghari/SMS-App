Smoking cessation programs for students who smoke

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend routine physical examinations but recommends blood pressure screenings every 3–5 years for adults 18–39 years of age who are at low risk for hypertension. Mammograms are not recommended until age 40. Lead screening is recommended for at-risk individuals between 6 months and 6 years of age. Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk individuals is recommended at age 50. Counseling on tobacco use and other substance abuse is recommended as part of all routine preventive care.
