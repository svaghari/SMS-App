Cool temperatures in the bedroom

Cognitive-behavioral therapy for chronic insomnia is known to be superior to pharmacologic therapies (SOR A) and can be effectively administered by primary care physicians (SOR B). An important component of cognitive-behavioral therapy is sleep hygiene education to identify behaviors that can interfere with sleep, such as pets in the bedroom, caffeine consumption after 4 p.m., exercising within 2 hours of bedtime, and nicotine use. It is also important to identify factors that can facilitate sleep, such as maintaining an environment conducive to sleep, including a cool room and a comfortable bed. Addressing misunderstandings about normal sleep, reinforcing factual sleep-related information, and addressing stimulus control, such as limiting use of the bedroom to sleep and sex and delaying going to bed until sleepy, are among the other key components of a comprehensive cognitive-behavioral therapy program for chronic insomnia.
