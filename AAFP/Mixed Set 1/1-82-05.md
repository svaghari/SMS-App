There is a 5% likelihood of the results having occurred by chance alone

The p-value is a level of statistical significance, and characterizes the likelihood of achieving the observed results of a study by chance alone, and in this case that likelihood is 5%. (In this case, 5% or less of the results can be achieved by chance alone and still be significant.) The confidence interval is a measure of variance and is derived from the test data. The p-value in and of itself says nothing about the truth or falsity of the null hypothesis, only that the likelihood of the observed results occurring by chance is 5%. The a or type I error is akin to the error of false-positive assignment; the B or type II error is analogous to the false-negative rate, or 1 - specificity, and cannot be calculated from the information given.
