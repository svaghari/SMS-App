Corticosteroids

Immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura is an acquired immune-mediated disorder defined as
isolated thrombocytopenia not found to have another cause. Treatment is usually restricted to severe
thrombocytopenic cases (platelet count <50,000/mm3) unless there is evidence of acute bleeding.
Corticosteroids are considered the first-line therapy (SOR C). Intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab
have also been used as first-line agents. Second-line therapies include thrombopoietin-receptor agonists
and splenectomy. Further evaluation, including a bone marrow biopsy, to rule out myelodysplastic
syndrome and lymphoproliferative disorders is indicated in patients over the age of 60 (SOR C). Platelet
transfusion is not indicated in the absence of hemorrhage or a need for surgery.
