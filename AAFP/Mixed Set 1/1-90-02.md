Calcitonin (Miacalcin)

Calcitonin, either intranasal or subcutaneous, provides pain relief within a few days in many patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The remainder of the choices do not provide acute relief. Vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty procedures are generally reserved for cases in which medical management has failed.
