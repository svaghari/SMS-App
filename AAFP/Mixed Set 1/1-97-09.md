Fragile X syndrome

The prepubescent male child with fragile X syndrome can be recognized by large ears, an elongated face, macrocephaly, or frontal bossing. This dysmorphic presentation can be subtle in young children, with an average age at diagnosis of 8 years. After puberty, a prominent jaw and macro-orchidism is characteristic. Although a child with Marfan syndrome has an elongated face, the frontal bossing and large ears are not characteristic of that condition. Prepubescent boys with Klinefelter syndrome do not have facial dysmorphic features. They appear similar to prepubescent boys with normal karyotypes. Facial dysmorphic features associated with Angelman syndrome include microbrachycephaly, maxillary hypoplasia, a large mouth, and prognathism. Facial dysmorphic features associated with Prader-Willi syndrome include a narrow distance between the temples, almond-shaped eyes, and a thin upper lip.
