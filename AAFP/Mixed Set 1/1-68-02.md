color Doppler ultrasonography

Any patient with a new scrotal mass should be evaluated immediately because of the risk of potential emergencies, such as testicular torsion, or of life-threatening diseases such as testicular carcinoma. Color Doppler ultrasonography is the test of choice for immediate evaluation of scrotal masses (SOR B) because it can be done quickly and has a high sensitivity (86%–88%) and specificity (90%–100%) for detecting testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency. Radionuclide imaging is also accurate in diagnosing testicular torsion, but involves too much of a time delay to be useful. CT and MRI should be used only if ultrasonography is inconclusive or carcinoma is suspected, and are particularly useful for staging testicular tumors. Pelvic radiographs are not recommended for evaluation of scrotal masses.
