Low-dose CT annually

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and the third most common cause of death overall. Smoking causes approximately 85% of all U.S. lung cancer deaths. Thirty-seven percent of U.S. adults are current or former smokers. While nearly 90% of people diagnosed with lung cancer will die from the disease, early-stage non–small cell lung cancer has a better prognosis and can be treated with surgical resection. The largest randomized, controlled trial of low-dose CT (LDCT) for lung cancer detection, the National Lung Screening Trial, enrolled 50,000 people age 55–74 with at least a 30-pack-year smoking history and showed a reduction in lung cancer mortality of 16% and a reduction in all-cause mortality of 6.7%. Based on this study and several other randomized, controlled trials, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has concluded that LDCT has a high sensitivity and an acceptable specificity for the detection of lung cancer in high-risk persons. The other testing modalities listed have not been validated as acceptable screening strategies for lung cancer.
