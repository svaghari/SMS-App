Villous adenomas

Colon cancer arises from adenomatous polyps, and generally requires at least 5 years of growth before malignant transformation. Villous adenomas carry a threefold increased risk for becoming malignant compared with other adenomatous types such as tubular or tubulovillous adenomas. The larger the polyp the greater the chance of malignancy, although malignant polyps <1.5 cm are rare. Hamartomas (juvenile polyps) and inflammatory polyps (often associated with inflammatory bowel disease) are benign. Hyperplastic polyps are the most common histologic type by far, but only rarely become cancerous.
