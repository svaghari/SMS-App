Inhibition of glucose production by the liver

Metformin has multiple mechanisms of action, but its main effect on serum glucose results from inhibition of gluconeogenesis in the liver. Sulfonylureas and meglitinides stimulate insulin release from the pancreas, and thiazolidinediones sensitize peripheral tissues to insulin. Carbohydrate absorption in the small intestine is inhibited by the "-glucosidase inhibitors.
