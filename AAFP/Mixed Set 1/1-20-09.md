Physical therapy with eccentric calf-strengthening exercises

This patient has typical symptoms and findings of Achilles tendinopathy. The best management involves
eccentric calf-strengthening exercises. A local injection with corticosteroids or with platelet-rich plasma
is ineffective and may increase the risk of a tendon rupture. Immobilization and surgical debridement may
be considered if more conservative therapies have failed.
