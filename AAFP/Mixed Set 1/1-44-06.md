No screening

All patients with a smoking history and symptoms of COPD such as a chronic cough with sputum production and/or chronic and progressive dyspnea should be screened for COPD with spirometry. However, asymptomatic individuals such as this patient should not be screened with spirometry regardless of risk factors. Neither chest radiography nor chest CT has a role in screening for COPD. Screening for Î±1-antitrypsin deficiency in the absence of a family history is not recommended.
