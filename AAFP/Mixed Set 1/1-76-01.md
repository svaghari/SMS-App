Genetic disorders

Genetic disorders (e.g., Waardenburg syndrome, Usher’s syndrome, Alport syndrome, and Turner’s syndrome) are responsible for more than 50% of hearing impairments in children.  Intraventricular hemorrhage is a central cause of hearing loss, and is rare.  Conductive abnormalities such as external canal anomalies and congenital cholesteatoma, and sensorineural causes other than genetic disorders (e.g., infectious diseases) are important but less frequent.
