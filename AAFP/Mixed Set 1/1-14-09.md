Immobilization in a thumb spica splint and an NSAID for 1–4 weeks

De Quervain’s tenosynovitis usually occurs with repeated use of the thumb and is
characterized by pain in the radial wrist. The course is typically self-limited but can last for
up to a year, so waiting would not be a good option for this patient who wants to continue
her usual activities as soon as possible. Conservative therapy with immobilization and
NSAIDs is recommended if there are no contraindications to NSAIDs. A corticosteroid
injection is helpful but is typically reserved for severe cases or if conservative therapy fails.
Surgery may be beneficial but is generally not recommended unless the course is severe,
given the natural history of resolution.
