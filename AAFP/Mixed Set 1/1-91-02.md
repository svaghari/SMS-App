Henoch-Schonlein purpura

The most common pediatric vasculitis is Henoch-Schonlein purpura. It is an IgA-mediated small-vessel vasculitis that classically presents with the triad of nonthrombocytopenic palpable purpura, colicky abdominal pain, and arthritis. Kawasaki disease is manifested by conjunctival injection, mucosal erythema, rash, and lymphadenopathy. Takayasu arteritis has numerous manifestations, including night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, myalgia, and arthritis. Later findings may include hypertension, skin lesions, and cardiac disorders. Wegener granulomatosis causes constitutional symptoms also, including weight loss and fatigue, with later findings including respiratory problems, ophthalmologic lesions, neuropathies, glomerulonephritis, and skin lesions. Polyarteritis nodosa is another disease that causes constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and myalgias. It also causes skin lesions, gastrointestinal symptoms such as postprandial abdominal pain, and cardiac lesions.
