With poorly functioning gastrointestinal tracts who cannot tolerate enteral feeding

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is indicated for patients with poorly functioning gastrointestinal tracts who cannot tolerate other means of nutritional support and for those with high caloric requirements that cannot otherwise be met. Patients who cannot swallow because of an esophageal motility problem and those who are resistant to feeding can be managed with tube feedings. Peripheral alimentation, which provides fewer calories than TPN or liquid tube feedings, would be more appropriate over the short term in patients recovering from surgery.
