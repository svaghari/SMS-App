A biopsy

Solar lentigines occur on sun-exposed skin and are known commonly as liver spots. A biopsy should be
performed if they grow rapidly, change rapidly, are painful, itch, bleed easily, heal poorly, or have an
atypical or suspicious appearance.
If no suspicious changes or symptoms are present there are various options for treatment, including topical
therapy with hydroquinone or retinoids, or ablative therapy with chemical peels, cryotherapy, intense
pulsed light, or laser therapies.
