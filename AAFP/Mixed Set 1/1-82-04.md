Fluoxetine (Prozac)

Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors that impair everyday functioning. SSRIs such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine are FDA-approved and considered first-line agents in the treatment of this condition. None of the other agents listed is recommended for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Lithium is useful in bipolar disease and depression, alprazolam is used in generalized anxiety and panic disorder, and amitriptyline is used in depression and chronic pain syndromes. Valproic acid is primarily an anti-epileptic agent. Ref: Dambro MR (ed): Griffith’s 5 Minute Consult 2004.
