He should go to the nearest emergency department

Patients with a peanut allergy can have reactions to infinitesimal amounts of peanut protein, including residue on the lips of other people. This patient has successfully interrupted the course of anaphylaxis. Diphenhydramine can help reduce subsequent symptoms, and prednisone is generally given, although its value is unproven. However, the patient is at risk of a biphasic reaction and should go to an emergency department where additional epinephrine and resuscitation facilities are available. The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline recommends that all peanut-allergic patients who require a dose of adrenalin be observed in an emergency department.

Patients who have not already had a full allergy evaluation need to see an allergist, but this patientâ€™s peanut allergy has been established. Peanut-allergic patients tend to have accidental exposure about once every 5 years in spite of efforts at avoidance.
