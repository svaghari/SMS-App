satisfactory improvement of vision in almost all patients

LASIK corrective vision surgery has become increasingly common over the last 20 years. A laser is used
to cut a flap the size of a contact lens consisting of corneal epithelium and stroma. This flap is repositioned
and heals without sutures.
It is important to counsel patients on realistic expectations. Vision following the procedure may not be as
clear as with glasses or contact lenses and some individuals still require external correction. Up to 40%
of patients experience dry eyes following the surgery (SOR B). These symptoms may be worse in patients
with chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia, migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome (SOR C).
Glares, halos, and starbursts may affect up to 20% of patients following LASIK. This may be especially
bothersome at night (SOR B).
LASIK does not correct age-related presbyopia (SOR C). Reading glasses may be necessary if this
develops in certain patients. Overall, however, most patients are satisfied with their results and only 3%
are unhappy with their vision following surgery (SOR C).
