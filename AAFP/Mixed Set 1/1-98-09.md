Topical retinoids

Comedones are noninflammatory acne lesions. Inflammatory lesions include papules, pustules, and nodules. Grading acne based on the type of lesion and severity helps guide therapy. Topical retinoids prevent the formation of comedones and reduce their number, and are indicated as monotherapy for noninflammatory acne. Topical antibiotics are used primarily for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory or mixed acne. Oral antibiotics are effective for the treatment of moderate to severe acne. Oral isotretinoin is reserved for treatment of severe, recalcitrant acne.
