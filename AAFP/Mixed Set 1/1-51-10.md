Estimated glomerular filtration rate

Until recently metformin was contraindicated for patients with renal dysfunction suggested by a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL for men and 1.4 mg/dL for women. However, available evidence now supports the use of metformin in individuals with mild to moderate chronic renal disease, defined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Patients with an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (chronic mild kidney disease) are now permitted to take metformin. Metformin should not be used in patients with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (moderate kidney disease), as lactic acidosis is more likely to occur. The eGFR is used instead of the serum creatinine level because the equation includes age, sex, race, and other parameters.
