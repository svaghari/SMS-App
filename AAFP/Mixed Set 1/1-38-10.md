Prompt aortic valve replacement

This patient should have his aortic valve replaced. He meets criteria for severe aortic stenosis with a transthoracic velocity ≥4.0 m/sec and an aortic valve area <1.0 cm2. Symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis have 2-year mortality rates of more than 50%. After valve replacement the 10-year survival rate is almost identical to that of patients without aortic stenosis. Watchful waiting with monitoring for symptoms and periodic echocardiograms is indicated for asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis who have a normal ejection fraction. There is no medical treatment that delays the progression of aortic valve disease or improves survival. Measures to reduce cardiovascular risk, including treatment of hypertension, are indicated. Rate-slowing calcium channel blockers and β-blockers that depress left ventricular function should be avoided if possible. ACE inhibitors may improve symptoms in patients with aortic stenosis who are not surgical candidates.
