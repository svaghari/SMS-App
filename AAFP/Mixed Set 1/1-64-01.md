serum prolactin

Anterior pituitary hormone overproduction is suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed by appropriate laboratory evaluation. The most common secretory pituitary adenomas are prolactinomas. They cause galactorrhea and hypogonadism, including amenorrhea, infertility, and impotence. Growth hormone–secreting tumors, which are the next most common secretory pituitary tumors, cause acromegaly or gigantism. Next in frequency are corticotropic (ACTH-secreting) adenomas, which cause cortisol excess (Cushing’s disease). Glycoprotein hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas (secreting TSH, LH, or FSH) are the least common. TSH-secreting adenomas are a rare cause of hyperthyroidism. Paradoxically, most patients with gonadotropin-secreting adenomas have hypogonadism.
