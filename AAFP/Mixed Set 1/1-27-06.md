180 mg/dL

Sepsis is a severe life-threatening disorder that has a 25%–30% mortality rate. Early aggressive management has been shown to decrease the mortality rate. The initial step in the management of sepsis is respiratory stabilization. Fluid resuscitation should be started and followed by vasopressor therapy if there is an inadequate blood pressure response. Antibiotics should be initiated within 1 hour of presentation. Other interventions in early goal-directed therapy that have been shown to improve mortality rates include blood transfusions, low-dose corticosteroid therapy, and conventional (not intensive) glycemic control with a target glucose level of <180 mg/dL. Intensive management of glucose in critically ill adult patients (a target glucose level of 80–110 mg/dL) has been shown to increase mortality.
