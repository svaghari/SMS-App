Oral combined hormonal contraceptives

Management of polycystic ovary syndrome is typically aimed at addressing patient symptoms, as well as irregular menses and the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. Infertility may become a therapeutic target for women who desire pregnancy at some point in their lives. In this patient, who needs contraception and hopes to address her hirsutism, combined oral contraceptives are most likely to address both concerns. In addition to suppressing ovulation they also suppress gonadotropin and ovarian androgen production. The estrogen component increases hepatic production of sex hormone binding globulin, thus decreasing androgen bioavailability.

Progestin-only pills and the levonorgestrel IUD protect against pregnancy but will not improve hirsutism. Cyclic progesterone every 1â€“3 months can be used to prevent endometrial hyperplasia but will not provide contraception or address hirsutism. Spironolactone is an androgen receptor antagonist that can decrease hair growth, but it will not provide contraception.
