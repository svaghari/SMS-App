the risk of harm from unnecessary procedures and treatment exceeds the potential benefit at her age

Annual HPV screening in patients age 21–29 years has very little effect on cancer prevention and leads to an increase in procedures and treatments without significant benefit. In this age group there is a high prevalence of high-risk HPV infections but a low incidence of cervical cancer. If this patient were due for a Papanicolaou (Pap) test and results were ASC-US with a positive high-risk HPV or a higher grade abnormality, colposcopy would be recommended. Current recommendations are for a Pap test with cytology every 3 years for women age 21–29 years with normal results, and the frequency does not change with an increased number of normal screens. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) and up to 79% of sexually active women contract HPV infection in their lifetime, so the lack of other STIs does not preclude the possibility of an HPV infection.
