An 8-year-old male with penile enlargement

Penile enlargement in an 8-year-old male is a sign of precocious puberty. Isolated sparse pubic and axillary hair growth and axillary odor is referred to as premature adrenarche, and represents high levels of dehydroepiandrosterone rather than activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis that leads to puberty. The isolated findings of premature adrenarche are generally considered benign. An 8-year-old with breast buds and a 10-year-old with menarche are within the normal range of expected pubertal development. Penile enlargement typically represents full activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and warrants endocrinologic evaluation in boys younger than 9 years of age.
