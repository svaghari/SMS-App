Hematocrit

Knowing the severity of pancreatitis helps predict how aggressive management should be. Hematocrit,
BUN, and creatinine levels are the most useful predictors of the severity of pancreatitis, reflecting the
degree of intravascular volume depletion. C-reactive protein is often elevated, but it is not as useful as
hematocrit for predicting severity. Serum amylase and lipase have no prognostic value. CT evidence of
severe pancreatitis lags behind clinical and laboratory evidence, and early CT underestimates the severity
of the acute process.
