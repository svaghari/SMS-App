Alzheimer’s disease

The patient shows classic symptoms of early Alzheimer’s disease, with difficulties in at least two cognitive domains that are severe enough to influence daily living. Normal aging changes can decrease one’s ability to retrieve information but do not influence daily living and are usually noticed more by the patient than by family members. Depression was previously thought to cause “pseudodementia” with significant regularity. However, several recent studies have shown that treating depressive symptoms does not result in significantly improved cognitive performance. It is now believed that progressive memory loss frequently results in depressive symptoms, rather than the converse. Lewy body dementia is associated with physical findings of parkinsonism and often the presence of visual hallucinations, both of which are absent in this patient. There are no signs of multiple infarcts on brain imaging, effectively ruling out this diagnosis. Ref: Karlawish JH, Clark CM: Diagnostic evaluation of elderly patients with mild memory problems.
