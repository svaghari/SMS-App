Audiometry is the best initial screening test

Acoustic neuroma symptoms are due to cranial nerve involvement and progression of tumor size. Hearing loss is present 95% of the time and tinnitus is very common. The loss is usually chronic (over 3 years) and as many as one-third of patients are unaware it has occurred. Vestibular nerve involvement most often causes mild unsteadiness and rarely has accompanying true vertigo. Trigeminal involvement can cause pain, paresthesias, or numbness of the face. Facial paresis occurs 6% of the time. The diagnosis of acoustic neuroma is based on asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss or another cranial nerve deficit, with confirmation based on MRI with gadolinium contrast or a CT scan. The best initial screening laboratory test is audiometry, as only 5% of patients with acoustic neuroma will have a normal test. Sensorineural loss is usually in the higher frequencies. Brainstem-evoked response audiometry may be used as a further screening measure when there are unexplained symmetrics and standard audiometric testing.
