A short-acting anticholinergic

This patient has COPD and is in a risk category of A (low risk, fewer symptoms) based on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) combined assessment of COPD. As a result, either a short-acting anticholinergic or a short-acting β2-agonist should be selected as the initial pharmacologic management. Long-acting β2-agonists or long-acting anticholinergics are indicated for patients with a GOLD combined assessment category of B or worse. Long-acting inhaled corticosteroids are indicated for patients with a GOLD combined assessment category of C or worse. Due to its narrow therapeutic window, modest benefit, and need for monitoring, theophylline is not recommended as an initial agent and should be considered as an alternative only for patients with severe refractory symptoms.
