An irreversible FEV1/FVC ratio <65%

A large cohort study indicated that the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criterion
(FEV1/FVC ratio <70%) is more sensitive for COPD in individuals 65 years and older compared to the
American Thoracic Society criteria (SOR C). COPD is present if the FEV1/FVC ratio is reduced to <70%
and is irreversible with bronchodilator therapy. A reversible response to bronchodilator therapy is more
consistent with asthma.
