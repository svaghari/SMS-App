Lorazepam (Ativan)

A patient with alcohol withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens) is best treated as an inpatient, usually in an intensive-care unit. Evaluation of these patients consists of a workup to identify comorbid medical conditions, and treatment includes supportive care, intravenous thiamine, and medications to control agitation, promote sleep, and raise the seizure threshold. The first-line pharmacologic agent for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal delirium is a benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam. The other medications listed are used as adjunctive treatment for severe symptoms or for patients who do not have an adequate response to high doses of benzodiazepines. They all may have significant side effects and offer few advantages for most patients compared to benzodiazepines.
