Psychogenic tremor

Psychogenic tremor is characterized by an abrupt onset, spontaneous remission, changing characteristics,
and extinction with distraction. Cerebellar tremor is an intention tremor with ipsilateral involvement on
the side of the lesion. Neurologic testing will reveal past-pointing on finger-to-nose testing. CT or MRI
of the head is the diagnostic test of choice. Parkinsonian tremor is noted at rest, is asymmetric, and
decreases with voluntary movement. Bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability are generally noted.
For atypical presentations a single-photon emission CT or positron emission tomography may help with
the diagnosis. One of the treatment options is carbidopa/levodopa.
Patients who have essential tremor have symmetric, fine tremors that may involve the hands, wrists, head,
voice, or lower extremities. This may improve with ingestion of small amounts of alcohol. There is no
specific diagnostic test but the tremor is treated with propranolol or primidone. Enhanced physiologic
tremor is a postural tremor of low amplitude exacerbated by medication. There is usually a history of
caffeine use or anxiety.
