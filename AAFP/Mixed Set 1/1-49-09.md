Order MRI of the foot

A stress fracture in the proximal fifth metatarsal is particularly prone to nonunion and completion of the fracture. Because complete nonâ€“weight bearing or surgical intervention may be necessary with this high-risk fracture, MRI is indicated as the most sensitive test. Bone scans are sensitive but nonspecific. Most stress fractures of the metatarsals occur distally and can be managed with a hard shoe initially, with progressive activity as tolerated. NSAIDs are discouraged because of possible effects on fracture healing.
