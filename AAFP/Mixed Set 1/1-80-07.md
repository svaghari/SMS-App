Admit to the hospital; obtain urine, blood, and CSF cultures; and start intravenous antibiotics

Any child younger than 29 days old with a fever and any child who appears toxic, regardless of age, should undergo a complete sepsis workup and be admitted to the hospital for observation until culture results are known or the source of the fever is found and treated (SOR A). Observation only, with close follow-up, is recommended for nontoxic infants 3-36 months of age with a temperature <39.0°C (102.2°F) (SOR B).  Children 29-90 days old who appear to be nontoxic and have negative screening laboratory studies, including a CBC and urinalysis, can be sent home with precautions and with follow-up in 24 hours (SOR B).  Testing for neonatal herpes simplex virus infection should be considered in patients with risk factors, including maternal infection at the time of delivery, use of fetal scalp electrodes, vaginal delivery, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, or herpetic lesions.  Testing also should be considered when a child does not respond to antibiotics (SOR C). Ref: Sur DK, Bukont EL: Evaluating fever of unidentifiable source in young children.
