Respiratory depression

Concerns about addiction and respiratory depression often limit the use of opioids or lead to inadequate dosages in patients with a terminal illness who are experiencing pain at the end of life (SOR C). Sedation (ranging from full consciousness to complete loss of consciousness) usually precedes respiratory depression. Opioid use and dosages can therefore be effectively managed with close monitoring for sedation, allowing patients to receive adequate medication to control pain. Close monitoring allows clinicians to identify advancing sedation before it is compounded by continued opioid administration that could lead to clinically significant respiratory depression (SOR C).
