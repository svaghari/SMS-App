A Pap smear is not indicated

After a hysterectomy for documented benign disease, cytologic screening may be discontinued. Papanicolaou (Pap) smears in this population are low yield and may cause unnecessary testing due to false-positives. Pap smears may be continued if the reason for the hysterectomy is uncertain. If there is a history of invasive cervical cancer or DES exposure, screening should be continued, although there is not a great deal of data to support this practice.
