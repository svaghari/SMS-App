Plantar fasciitis

Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain, affecting more than 2 million people each year.
The pain is typically worst when the patient first gets out of bed and improves with activity. Calcaneal
stress fractures follow an increase in activity, and the pain tends to worsen with activity and is eventually
present all of the time. Achilles tendinopathy is an aching pain that also worsens with increased activity,
and there is often tenderness along the tendon. Neuromas present with a burning, tingling, or numb
sensation and a painful lump.
