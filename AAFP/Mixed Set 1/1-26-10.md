Enoxaparin (Lovenox)

In a patient with cancer, deep vein thrombosis of the leg or a pulmonary embolus is considered to be cancer-associated thrombosis. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), such as enoxaparin, should be chosen over the other anticoagulant options listed. (LMWH over warfarin is a Grade 2B recommendation; LMWH over dabigatran is a Grade 2C recommendation; LMWH over rivaroxaban is a Grade 2C recommendation; and LMWH over apixaban or edoxaban is a Grade 2C recommendation).
