Hemolytic anemia

Several factors can alter the hemoglobin A1c value, including variability and erythrocyte lifespan. When the mean erythrocyte lifespan is increased by a condition such as asplenia, hemoglobin A1c increases because of increased RBC exposure time for glycation. Conversely, when the mean erythrocyte lifespan is decreased by conditions such as hemolytic anemia, hemoglobin A1c is decreased because of reduced RBC exposure time for glycation. Conditions that decrease erythropoiesis, such as iron deficiency anemia, increase the mean age of the RBC, thereby increasing hemoglobin A1c. Severe chronic kidney disease may increase RBC glycation through lipid peroxidase of hemoglobin and by extending the erythrocyte lifespan due to decreased erythropoietin levels, causing a false elevation of hemoglobin A1c. Vitamin B12 deficiency also decreases erythropoiesis and leads to falsely elevated hemoglobin A1c.
