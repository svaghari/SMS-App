Hyperparathyroidism

Hyperparathyroidism is present in more than half of patients who have a glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min, and is independently associated with increased mortality and an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease. In patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease, current guidelines recommend monitoring of serum calcium and phosphate levels every 3–6 months and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase activity every 6–12 months with the goal of normalizing these values. The other metabolic abnormalities listed are less common than hyperparathyroidism.
