Bupropion (Wellbutrin), 150 mg twice daily

Bupropion can improve antidepressant-related sexual arousal dysfunction (SOR B). Black cohosh is
considered a safe alternative for treating menopausal vasomotor symptoms, but not for treating sexual
arousal dysfunction in women who are premenopausal. Ethinyl estradiol may be taken to improve sexual
dysfunction related to menopausal symptoms. Vaginal estrogen therapy is recommended over oral estrogen
when vaginal dryness is the primary symptom. Ospemifene is indicated for dyspareunia related to vulvar
and vaginal atrophy due to menopause. Testosterone has proven to be effective for treating menopause-
9
related low sexual desire but the evidence is limited due to the lack of long-term data. The Endocrine
Society recommends consideration of a 3- to 6-month course of testosterone specifically for
postmenopausal women with low sexual desire.
