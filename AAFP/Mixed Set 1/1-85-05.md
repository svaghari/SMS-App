Adenosine (Adenocard)

Patients with persistent supraventricular tachycardias require immediate medical attention. A patient who
has no underlying heart disease and a regular, narrow complex tachycardia should be treated with
adenosine. If the patient does not respond to this treatment, cardioversion should be considered.
Vasopressin would be useful if the patient were unstable with a ventricular tachycardia.
