Deer mice

Up through July of 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had logged 624 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in residents of 34 states. The infection killed more than a third of the victims. The virus is usually spread by inhalation of dried aerosolized deer mouse urine or droppings. Infected deer mice usually have few outward signs. Other hosts include the white-footed mouse, the rice rat, and the cotton rat. Other rodents have not been shown to carry the virus.
