Doxycycline

The treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) must be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected in order to decrease mortality. Doxycycline is the only approved therapy for RMSF for individuals of all ages, including children <8 years of age. Of the other options listed, only rifampin and chloramphenicol have been used for the treatment of RMSF, but they are not FDA approved.

Providing supportive care or waiting for confirmation of the diagnosis would not be appropriate. Laboratory tests such as a CBC and chemistries can be helpful in looking for other causes of a patient’s symptoms but findings will not be specific for RMSF. Serologies may be helpful but are not available immediately and may be negative early in the disease process.
