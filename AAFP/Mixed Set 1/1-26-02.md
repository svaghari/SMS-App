Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) for 3 days

Acute uncomplicated cystitis responds well to 3 days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 160/800 mg twice daily. Increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones has been seen and they are therefore less likely to be successful. Because of the association with tendon rupture they are also not considered first-line treatment. Î²-Lactam agents have similar resistance issues. Azithromycin is not indicated for urinary tract infections.

Ibuprofen alone has produced good symptom relief, but antibiotics are frequently needed
for a definitive cure. The presence of diabetes or prediabetes should not change treatment (SOR A, SOR C).
