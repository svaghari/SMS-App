Improved efficacy

The recombinant zoster vaccine is preferred over the live zoster vaccine due to its increased efficacy. The recombinant vaccine is estimated to be about 97% effective for preventing shingles, compared to 51% with the live vaccine. It requires two intramuscular doses separated by 2–6 months, compared to only one subcutaneous dose with the live vaccine. It is also slightly more expensive than the live vaccine. Although the recombinant vaccine is not a live vaccine, studies are still ongoing as to whether it is safe to give to immunocompromised patients.
