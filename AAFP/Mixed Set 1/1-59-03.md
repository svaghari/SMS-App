Hip fracture

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are safe and well tolerated for short-term use. It is recommended that the lowest dosage and shortest duration of therapy be used to control symptoms of GERD. Long-term PPI use is associated with fractures, hypomagnesemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency, and acute interstitial nephritis with progression to chronic kidney disease. Use of PPIs has also been associated with community-acquired pneumonia and Clostridium difficile infection, although studies have been conflicting. Vitamin D deficiency, nephrotic syndrome, gastrointestinal malignancy, and myocardial infarction are not proven complications of long-term PPI use.
