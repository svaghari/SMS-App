Pyloric stenosis

Pyloric stenosis fits the described scenario; it is characterized by the early onset of worsening projectile vomiting and poor weight gain, and occurs most often in full-term male infants who are otherwise healthy. Formula intolerance causes regurgitation, as would inappropriate feeding. Meningitis, whether viral or bacterial, would be associated with fever. Viral gastroenteritis is a common cause of vomiting in older children, and is usually associated with fever and diarrhea. Ref: Rudolph CD, Rudolph AM (eds): Rudolphâ€™s Pediatrics, ed 21.
