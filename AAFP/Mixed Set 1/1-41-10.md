Ranitidine (Zantac)

First- and second-generation H1 antihistamine receptor antagonists are generally considered first-line treatment for chronic urticaria, and approximately 60% of patients experience a satisfactory result. Second-generation options such as loratadine have the added benefit of a lower likelihood of side effects such as drowsiness. For those who fail to achieve the desired result with monotherapy using an H1 antihistamine receptor antagonist, the addition of an H2 antihistamine receptor antagonist such as cimetidine or ranitidine is often beneficial. The tricyclic antidepressant doxepin has strong H1 and H2 antihistamine receptor antagonist effects and has been used as an off-label treatment option in some studies. A short course of oral corticosteroids, narrow-band UV light treatment, or cyclosporine can be used in the management of recalcitrant chronic urticaria, but these are considered second- or third-line adjunctive options.
