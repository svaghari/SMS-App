ultrasonography

Recognizing clinically significant abnormalities on the newborn examination is important. Newborns with
small sacral dimples located far from the anal verge, without other skin findings such as hair, do not need
imaging to rule out spinal dysraphism (tethered cord). While the exact parameters of what is considered
large (>0.5 cm diameter) and close (within 2.5 cm of the anal verge) can easily be found in reference
materials, the dimple described here is clearly concerning and needs imaging. Ultrasonography can
accurately and safely detect spinal dysraphism in these cases.
