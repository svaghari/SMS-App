Start basal insulin at 10 units/day

According to the American Diabetes Association’s 2018 guidelines for the management of diabetes, a healthy person with a reasonable life expectancy should have a hemoglobin A1c goal of <7%. Metformin is recommended as first-line therapy as long as there are no contraindications. If the hemoglobin A1c is not at the goal or is ≥9%, then adding another agent to metformin is recommended. Basal insulin at 10 units/day is an acceptable choice for additional therapy to improve blood glucose control. Diet, exercise, and home monitoring of blood glucose are recommended in addition to starting another agent for blood glucose control.
