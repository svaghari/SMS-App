Escitalopram (Lexapro)

Escitalopram is a preferred antidepressant for older patients (SOR C). Paroxetine should generally be avoided in older patients due to a higher likelihood of adverse effects (SOR C). Amitriptyline, imipramine, and paroxetine are highly anticholinergic and sedating, and according to the Beers Criteria, they can cause orthostatic hypotension. They have an “avoid” recommendation (SOR A).
