Moderate persistent

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) classifies asthma into four categories. Mild intermittent asthma is characterized by daytime symptoms occurring no more than 2 days per week and nighttime symptoms no more than 2 nights per month. The peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is 80% or more of predicted. Mild persistent asthma is characterized by daytime symptoms more than 2 days per week, but less than once a day, and nighttime symptoms more than 2 nights per month. PEF or FEV1 is 80% or more of predicted. Moderate persistent asthma is characterized by daytime symptoms daily and nighttime symptoms more than 1 night per week. PEF or FEV1 is 60%â€“80% of predicted. Severe persistent asthma is characterized by continuous daytime symptoms and frequent nighttime symptoms. PEF or FEV1 is 60% or less of predicted.
