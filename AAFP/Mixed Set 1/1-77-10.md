Education on positioning

Nipple pain with breastfeeding is extremely common, with some studies reporting a prevalence of up to 96%. Preventing or alleviating nipple pain is important for comfort, but also for promoting breastfeeding in general. The best intervention for nipple pain is education on proper positioning and attachment of the infant. Topical remedies may also be effective, although no one topical agent has been shown to be clearly superior, and none is as effective as education on positioning and latch-on.
