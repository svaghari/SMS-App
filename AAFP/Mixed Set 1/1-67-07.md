Crown-rump length at 10 weeks of pregnancy

Estimation of gestational age by ultrasound is most accurate early in the first trimester and begins to decline by 22 weeks gestation. Crown-rump length is typically used to estimate gestational age before 13 weeks gestation. After 11 weeks gestation, combinations of biparietal diameter, femur length, head circumference, and abdominal circumference are used to estimate the gestational age. These factors are used by the software that generates ultrasonography reports.
