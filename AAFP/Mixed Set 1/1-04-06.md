Prazosin (Minipress)

An SSRI or SNRI should be used first as monotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and should be optimized before an additional agent is added. Prazosin is an effective augmenting therapy for patients with PTSD and sleep disturbance (SOR B). Other α-blockers and β-blockers have been shown to be ineffective in the treatment of PTSD. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam can treat symptoms of hyperarousal but have been associated with adverse effects and should be avoided in the treatment of PTSD (SOR B). Hypnotics such as zolpidem are generally reserved for short-term use. There is no evidence to support the use of atypical antipsychotics for PTSD and their use should be avoided (SOR C).
