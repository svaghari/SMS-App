Multiple good quality randomized, controlled trials

Family medicine journals, including American Family Physician, The Journal of Family Practice, and The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine utilize the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) to label key recommendations in clinical review articles. These grades are assigned on the basis of the quality and consistency of available evidence. The Cochrane Collaboration is an extensive database of systematic reviews and clinical trials. A Cochrane review with a clear recommendation warrants a strength of recommendation rating of A. This indicates consistent, good quality, patient-oriented evidence. Consistent findings from at least two randomized, controlled studies or a systematic review/meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials are also assigned a level A strength of recommendation. Expert opinion and consensus guidelines are assigned a level C strength of recommendation. SORT also includes a grade of 1 to 3 for levels of evidence. Retrospective cohort studies are considered level 2.
