A 50-year-old female with a comminuted fracture

Midshaft clavicle fractures are usually treated nonoperatively, but have a higher risk of nonunion. Risk
factors for nonunion include female gender, fracture comminution or displacement, clavicle shortening,
advanced age, and greater extent of initial trauma. These fractures in children heal extremely well, even
if displaced or comminuted, because of periosteal regenerative potential.
