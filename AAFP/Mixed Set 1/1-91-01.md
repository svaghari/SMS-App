Influenza-like illness

Influenza has a very abrupt onset, and a fever with a nonproductive cough is almost always present. Unconfirmed cases are referred to as influenza-like illness (ILI) or suspected influenza. Patients with confirmed cases tend to say they have never been so ill. Mycoplasma pneumonia can spread among family members, but it is milder and has a more indolent onset and a longer incubation period. Bacterial bronchitis is an overdiagnosed, supposed complication of upper respiratory infections, and is not contagious. While the phrase cold and flu is often used, upper respiratory infections are not so febrile or prostrating, and coryza is the dominant syndrome sooner or later. Legionella can have point-source epidemics, but the incubation period is longer, symptoms vary from mild illness to life-threatening pneumonia, and diarrhea is prominent in many cases.
