Polycythemia

Testosterone increases hematocrit and can cause polycythemia.  In patients receiving testosterone supplementation, hematocrit should be monitored every 6 months for the first 18 months, then annually.  Testosterone should be discontinued if there is more than a 50% rise in hematocrit.  Testosterone also causes an increase in lean body mass, and may increase bone density.
