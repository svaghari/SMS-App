40

According to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, adults age 40–70 should be screened for diabetes mellitus if they are overweight (BMI >25.0 kg/m2) or obese (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2), so this patient should not be screened until age 40. Screening for diabetes mellitus should be considered for any adult who has a risk factor such as a family history of diabetes, a personal history of gestational diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, or being a member of a high-risk ethnic group (African-American, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaskan Native, or Native Hawaiian).
