Celiac sprue

Celiac sprue is a condition of acquired malabsorption that resolves when the patient is exposed to a gluten-free diet. Gluten is a substance found in wheat, rye, and barley, but not in corn or rice products. Children with this sensitivity will develop inflammation and destruction of the microvilli in the small intestine as a result of an immune response to gluten. Patients with celiac sprue often present as this child has, between 4 and 24 months of age with impaired growth, diarrhea, and abdominal distention. An iron deficiency anemia can occur with impairment of iron absorption from the small intestine. Lesser cases of malabsorption are common, and this condition often goes unrecognized into adolescence or adulthood. Serologic tests, and ultimately a biopsy of the small intestine, can confirm the diagnosis. Ref: Farrell RJ, Kelly CP: Current concepts: Celiac sprue. N Engl J Med 2002;346(3):180-188.
