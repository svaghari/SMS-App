Intralesional corticosteroids

This patient has alopecia areata, which is a chronic, relapsing, immune-mediated inflammatory disorder affecting hair follicles that results in patchy hair loss. The treatment of choice is intralesional corticosteroid injections. Topical immunotherapy is reserved for patients with extensive disease, such as >50% scalp involvement. Topical corticosteroids are less effective and are usually reserved for children and adults who cannot tolerate intralesional injections. Minoxidil is used for androgenetic alopecia and is less effective for alopecia areata. Oral antifungal drugs are used to treat tinea capitis.
