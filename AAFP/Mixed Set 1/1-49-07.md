a change in stool frequency

The Rome IV criteria are widely used as guidelines to diagnose suspected irritable bowel syndrome. These criteria specify that there should be recurrent abdominal pain associated with two or more additional symptoms at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months. These symptoms include pain related to defecation, a change in stool frequency, or a change in stool form. Pain brought on by eating and increased gas and bloating are observed in irritable bowel syndrome but are not included in the Rome IV criteria. Weight loss and waking at night to defecate are not typically seen in this disorder.
