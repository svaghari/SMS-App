Eliminating the sources of lead in the community

Although lead poisoning in children has decreased over the past few decades it is still a problem in the pediatric population. The most reliable and cost-effective way to protect U.S. children from lead toxicity is primary prevention, which includes reducing or eliminating the sources of lead in the community. Checking serum lead levels after exposures, anticipatory guidance regarding hand washing or dust control, iron and calcium supplementation, and providing cleaning equipment have been shown to have either little or no effect, or they address high lead levels only after the lead poisoning has occurred.
