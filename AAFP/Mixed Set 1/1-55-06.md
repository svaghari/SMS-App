Amitriptyline

Amitriptyline may reduce headache duration and severity compared with placebo for chronic tension-type headaches (SOR B). SSRIs have no proven benefit for headache prophylaxis over placebo or tricyclic antidepressants in patients with chronic daily headaches. Propranolol reduces the frequency of migraine headaches, although its effectiveness for chronic migraine is unclear. Propranolol is not effective for tension headaches. Topiramate can reduce the frequency of chronic migraine headaches by 50% but is not effective for tension-type headaches. OnabotulinumtoxinA has been shown to reduce headache frequency in chronic migraine, but evidence of its effectiveness is lacking for chronic tension-type headaches.
