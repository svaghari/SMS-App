90%

The results of this urine test were that 10 people had the disease and tested positive (true positives); 8 people had the disease but tested negative (false negatives); 17 people did not have the disease (27 – 10) but tested positive (false positive); 69 people did not have the disease (77 – 8) and tested negative (true negative). The negative predictive value is determined by dividing the true negatives (69) by the total number who tested negative (true plus false negatives = 77). The result is 89.6%, which rounded to a whole number is 90%.
