Backup contraception is not necessary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides specific recommendations for backup
contraception after IUD insertion. According to the CDC guidelines, this patient does not need to use
backup contraception if her IUD is inserted today because it was inserted within 7 days after menstrual
bleeding started. If the levonorgestrel IUD is inserted more than 7 days after menstrual bleeding starts,
the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next
7 days.
