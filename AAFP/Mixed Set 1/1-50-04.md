Topical antifungal agents

Seborrheic dermatitis is commonly seen in the office setting and affects the scalp, eyebrows, nasolabial folds, and anterior chest. The affected skin appears as erythematous patches with white to yellow greasy scales. The etiology is not exactly known, but it is likely that the yeast Malassezia plays a role. Topical antifungals are effective and recommended as first-line agents. Topical low-potency corticosteroids are also effective alone or when used in combination with topical antifungals, but they should be used sparingly due to their adverse effects. The other agents listed have no role in the management of seborrheic dermatitis (SOR A).
