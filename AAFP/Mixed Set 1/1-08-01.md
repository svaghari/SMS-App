Hip fractures

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including omeprazole, are generally safe and effective for peptic ulcer
disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and stress ulcer prevention in critically ill patients. As use has
increased, however, risks of long-term use of PPIs have emerged. Currently known risks include increased
fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine (SOR B), community-acquired pneumonia (SOR B), Clostridium
difficile and other enteric infections (SOR C), hypomagnesemia (SOR B), and cardiac events when
coadministered with clopidogrel (SOR B). PPIs may also affect the absorption of vitamins and minerals,
including iron, vitamin B12, and folate (SOR C). There is no known association of PPIs with nephrolithiasis
or urinary tract infections.
