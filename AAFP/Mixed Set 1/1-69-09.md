A urea breath test

There is strong evidence that eradication of H. pylori improves healing and reduces the risk of recurrence or rebleeding in patients with duodenal or gastric ulcer. A test-and-treat approach is recommended for most patients with undifferentiated dyspepsia. This strategy reduces the need for antisecretory medications, as well as the number of endoscopies. The currently recommended test for eradication of H. pylori in this clinical setting is either the urea breath test or H. pylori stool antigen.
  Serology remains positive for months after eradication and may give misleading information. Although upper endoscopy, with a biopsy for histology, urease activity, or culture, can be used to test for eradication, it is an invasive procedure with a higher cost and the potential for more morbidity compared to the urea breath test or the H. pylori stool antigen test. Rather than recommending endoscopy for all patients, most national guidelines suggest a test-and-treat strategy unless the patient is over 45 years old or has red flags for malignancy or a complicated ulcer. Although an upper gastrointestinal series might provide information about gross pathology, it will not provide information about the eradication of H. pylori following treatment.
