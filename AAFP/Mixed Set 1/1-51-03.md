Compression therapy

This patient likely has a venous stasis ulceration. The use of compression therapy with a pressure of 30â€“40 mm Hg is the mainstay of treatment. There is no evidence for the use of systemic antibiotics for lower-extremity ulcerations. Likewise, there is no evidence to support the use of either silver-based or honey-based preparations in ulcerations with no infection. Foam dressings are no more effective than other standard dressings.
