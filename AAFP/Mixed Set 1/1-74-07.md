Sertraline (Zoloft)

Several studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are safe and effective in treating depression in patients with coronary disease, particularly those with a history of previous episodes of depression.  Medications have performed significantly better than intensive interpersonal psychotherapy in this setting.  Electroconvulsive therapy is not considered first-line therapy in the absence of severe symptoms.  While it may be effective for sleep disturbance, amitriptyline has potential cardiac side effects and is unlikely to be effective for the treatment of depression in low doses.
