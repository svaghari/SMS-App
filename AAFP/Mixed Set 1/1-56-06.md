β-hCG

25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels should not be measured in patients presenting with fatigue (SOR A). A serum antibody test for Lyme disease or a D-dimer would not be indicated for this patient based on her history and symptoms. Because of the patient’s history of irregular menses, a β-hCG level would be indicated.
