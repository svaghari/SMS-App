myoglobinuria

A positive dipstick for hemoglobin without any RBCs noted in the urine sediment indicates either free hemoglobin or myoglobin in the urine.  Since the specimen in this case was a fresh sample, significant RBC hemolysis within the urine would not be expected.  If a transfusion reaction occurs, haptoglobin binds enough free hemoglobin in the serum to give it a pink coloration.  Only when haptoglobin is saturated will the free hemoglobin be excreted in the urine.  Myoglobin is released when skeletal muscle is destroyed by trauma, infarction, or intrinsic muscle disease.  If the hematuria were due to trauma there would be many RBCs visible on microscopic examination of the urine. Free hemoglobin resorption from hematomas does not occur.  Porphyria may cause urine to be burgundy colored, but it is not associated with a positive urine test for hemoglobin. Ref: Sauret JM, Marinides G, Wang GK: Rhabdomyolysis.
