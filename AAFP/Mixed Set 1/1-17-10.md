Tamsulosin (Flomax)

Tamsulosin promotes passage of ureter stones that are 5â€“10 mm in diameter. The number needed to treat
is five patients to cause the expulsion of one stone (SOR B). There was no difference in the percentage of
patients passing stones smaller than 5 mm when comparing tamsulosin to placebo, as these stones have a
high rate of spontaneous passage without any intervention. Naproxen and promethazine are sometimes used
for the management of pain and nausea associated with stones, but they have not been shown to facilitate
stone expulsion. Ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin are used to treat urinary tract infections but have not
been shown to facilitate stone expulsion.
