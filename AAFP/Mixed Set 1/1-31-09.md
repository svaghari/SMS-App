A long-acting anticholinergic inhaler

To decrease the patient’s frequent use of a short-acting bronchodilator, the addition of a long-acting anticholinergic inhaler for maintenance is most reasonable. Such medications have been demonstrated to improve quality of life and reduce hospitalizations. Evidence has demonstrated that a β-agonist combined with an inhaled corticosteroid would not be as preferable in this case, as they can increase the incidence of pneumonia. Long-acting theophylline and roflumilast may be added to the regimen of patients still symptomatic on triple therapy with long-acting β2-agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, and anticholinergic bronchodilators.
