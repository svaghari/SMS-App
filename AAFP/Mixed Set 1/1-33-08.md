Cyclobenzaprine

NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants are effective for the treatment of acute low back pain (SOR A). There is moderate-quality evidence that nonbenzodiazepine muscle relaxants are beneficial in the treatment of acute low back pain. There is also moderate-quality evidence that NSAIDs combined with nonbenzodiazepine muscle relaxants may have additive benefit for decreasing pain. Bed rest is not helpful in the treatment of acute back pain and is not recommended (SOR A). There is no evidence that lumbar support is helpful. Oral corticosteroids have not been found to be beneficial for isolated low back pain, but there is questionable benefit when there are associated radicular symptoms. There are several low-quality trials that show acupuncture has minimal or no benefit over sham treatment in acute back pain.
