Ischemic stroke

A history of an ischemic stroke within the past 3 months is an absolute contraindication to fibrinolytic therapy in patients with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), unless the stroke is diagnosed within 4½ hours. Poorly controlled hypertension, dementia, peptic ulcer disease, and major surgery less than 3 weeks before the STEMI are relative contraindications that should be considered on an individual basis.
