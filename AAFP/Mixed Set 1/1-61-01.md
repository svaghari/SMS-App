A low-impact aerobic exercise program

Despite the prevalence of osteoarthritis of the knee and a myriad of treatment modalities available for those with symptomatic disease, there is very limited evidence to suggest that many of these treatments are effective. There is strong evidence to suggest that self-management programs, strengthening exercises, low-impact aerobic exercises, and neuromuscular education have some benefit. Moderate evidence recommends against the use of needle lavage of the knee; the two main studies of this modality showed little or no benefit. In 15 studies, 14 outcomes were not statistically significant, including three pain and three functional outcomes. There is also moderate evidence to recommend against the use of lateral wedge insoles. Four studies of lateral wedge insoles showed no significant change in pain or function of the knee when compared to neutral insoles. The evidence is inconclusive for platelet-rich plasma injections. A few studies have shown decreased pain in patients after injection, but there was no placebo control, so the effectiveness cannot be adequately assessed. Glucosamine and chondroitin have been shown with strong evidence to be ineffective when compared to placebo.
