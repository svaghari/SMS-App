Value-based reimbursement

Value is often defined as quality divided by cost. As such, the value that a health care system provides increases as the quality of that care increases, the costs of the care decrease, or both. Value-based reimbursement is a system of health care reimbursement that seeks to motivate health care systems and/or providers to increase the value of their services rather than just seeking to increase the quantity of their services. An example of this type of payment incentive is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Servicesâ€™s move to establish a program called value-based purchasing. This program increases reimbursement rates for high-value hospitals and decreases reimbursement rates for hospitals that provide lower-value services.
