Cilostazol (Pletal)

A trial of cilostazol is recommended by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart
Association as initial treatment for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) that limits the lifestyle of patients
without heart failure (SOR A). Cilostazol has been shown to increase walking distance and improve
health-related quality of life (level of evidence 2). Although neither aspirin nor clopidogrel improves
claudication symptoms, antiplatelet therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction,
stroke, or vascular death in patients with symptomatic PAD. Warfarin has not been shown to improve
cardiovascular outcomes in patients with PAD, but may increase bleeding without clinical benefit. The
available evidence indicates that the benefit of pentoxifylline is marginal, and it is, at best, a second-line
alternative to cilostazol.
