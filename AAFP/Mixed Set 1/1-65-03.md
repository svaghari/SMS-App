Antiphospholipid syndrome

The antiphospholipid syndrome is due to the appearance of a heterogeneous group of circulating antibodies to negatively charged phospholipids, including most commonly a lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. The antibodies are usually detected by a false-positive serologic test for syphilis. Clinical features include venous and arterial thrombosis, fetal wastage, thrombocytopenia, and the presence of an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) inhibitor. It is an important diagnostic consideration in all patients with unexplained thrombosis or cerebral infarction, particularly in young patients.
Although hemophilia would also be associated with a prolonged aPTT, the PTT would normalize when
the patientâ€™s serum was mixed with normal plasma. Neurosyphilis is excluded by the negative serum FTAABS result. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is not associated with prolongation of the aPTT and is associated with a hemolytic anemia. Although protein C deficiency is a hypercoagulable state that can lead to stroke, none of the laboratory abnormalities suggests this diagnosis.
