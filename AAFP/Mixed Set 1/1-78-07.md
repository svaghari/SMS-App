Parvovirus B19

Also known as erythema infectiosum or fifth disease, parvovirus B19 infection is a fairly common cause of an exanthematous rash and arthritis in younger women. This infection should be particularly suspected in health-care workers who have frequent contact with children. The specific characteristics of the rash, the pattern of joint involvement, and the place of employment in an otherwise healthy person all offer clues suggesting parvovirus B19 as the infecting agent. Measles virus, adenovirus, and HIV rarely cause arthritis, although HIV infection can cause a musculoskeletal syndrome later in the disease. Varicella-zoster virus may cause large-joint arthritis, but the rash is distinctively vesicular and pruritic.
