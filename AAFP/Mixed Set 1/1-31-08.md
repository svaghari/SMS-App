can be performed by the physician

The Joint Commission for Hospital Accreditation now requires a patient spiritual assessment upon hospital admission. Using the FICA Spiritual History Tool or HOPE questions for making the spiritual assessment is appropriate for the physician. HOPE is a mnemonic for sources of Hope, Organized religion, Personal spirituality and practices, and Effects on medical care and end-of-life issues. The FICA tool includes questions in the categories of Faith and beliefs, Importance, Community, and how to Address these issues when providing care. It is very appropriate for a physician to conduct a spiritual assessment in older, hospitalized patients with critical or terminal illnesses. Some patients may consider themselves spiritual but not necessarily religious.
