Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)

The patient is experiencing an acute cognitive change from baseline, indicating possible delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a delirium diagnosis tool useful for evaluating acute cognitive changes. The other tests listed, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, Mini-Cog, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Saint Louis Mental Status exam, test chronic baseline cognitive function and are not designed to test for acute changes.
