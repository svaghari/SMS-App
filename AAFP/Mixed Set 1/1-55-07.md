Pregabalin (Lyrica)

Pregabalin is considered first-line therapy for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (SOR A). Based on a meta-analysis, the American Academy of Neurology recommends pregabalin as first-line medication and gabapentin as a first-line alternative. While opioids such as oxycodone may provide a possible benefit in the treatment of neuropathy, the risk of dependency and adverse effects limits their use to patients with pain not relieved by first-line therapies. Acupuncture is not recommended as a first-line therapy due to the lack of high-quality, randomized, controlled trials. Venlafaxine and lidocaine 5% spray are considered second-line therapies.
