3 months

Patients who have a venous thromboembolism (VTE) require anticoagulation therapy for treatment and
prevention of recurrence. The risk of recurrence is greatest in the first year after the event and remains
elevated indefinitely. The risk for VTE recurrence is dependent on patient factors, such as active cancers
and thrombophilia. Current guidelines recommend treatment for at least 3 months. In patients who have
a reversible provoking factor such as surgery, anticoagulation beyond 3 months is not recommended.
