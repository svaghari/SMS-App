Taper oxycodone by 5%–10% every 1–4 weeks

According to the Choosing Wisely recommendations from the American Society of Anesthesiologists, opioids should not be used as first-line therapy for chronic noncancer pain. However, more than one-half of patients who receive continuous opioids for 90 days are still receiving them after 4 years. Chronic opioids should not be abruptly discontinued. When discontinuing chronic opioid therapy, the best practice is to reduce the dosage by 5%–10% every 1–4 weeks, but even this may be too fast for some patients.

While controlled substance prescribing plans are considered good practice for long-term opioid use, continuing opioids for this patient would not be good practice given the indication of chronic noncancer pain and the need for safety in her work. Because her use of opioids should be tapered, weekly urine drug screens would continue to be positive and therefore would not be an appropriate management strategy for this patient. NSAIDs are not indicated for this patient due to her history of gastric bypass.
