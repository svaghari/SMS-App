Prednisone, 10–20 mg once daily

The patient described has polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). The hallmark of this condition is the rapid and often dramatic response, typically within a few days, to low-dose corticosteroids. In fact, the lack of response to low-dose prednisone in such a case should prompt the physician to consider another diagnosis.

A related condition, giant cell arteritis, is associated with transient or even permanent vision loss, typically unilateral but sometimes bilateral. This condition usually presents with headache and tenderness of the affected artery, most commonly the temporal artery. Prompt recognition and the initiation of high-dose corticosteroids are keys to preventing blindness.

The other options listed are not pertinent to the management of PMR. While prompt response to low-dose corticosteroids confirms the diagnosis, they are usually continued for 1–2 years, with gradual tapering beginning several months after initiation of treatment (SOR C).
