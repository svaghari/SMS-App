Pneumococcal vaccine and meningococcal vaccine

Pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines are currently recommended for patients with asplenia.  Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine can be considered as well. Emergency splenectomy for trauma is an indication for vaccination, even though splenic remnants may persist. Ref: Zimmerman RK, Middleton DB: Vaccines for persons at high risk, 2007.
