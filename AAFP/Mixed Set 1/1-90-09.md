Magnesium sulfate

Magnesium sulfate infusions must be carefully monitored because respiratory depression is a potential lethal side effect. Reflexes are usually lost first. Terbutaline and ritodrine have the potential to cause respiratory distress in the form of pulmonary edema. They do not cause respiratory depression. Indomethacin and nifedipine are rarely used tocolytics that do not depress respiration. Ref: DeCherney AH, Nathan L: Current Obstetrics and Gynecology: Diagnosis and Treatment, ed 9.
