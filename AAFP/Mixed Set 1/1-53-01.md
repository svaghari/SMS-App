Polycystic ovary syndrome

The most common cause of hirsutism in premenopausal women is polycystic ovary syndrome, which
accounts for 75%–80% of cases. The second most common cause is idiopathic hirsutism, which accounts
for 5%–20% of cases. Other causes are rare, but should be considered when evaluating new cases of
hirsutism.
