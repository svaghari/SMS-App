Diltiazem (Cardizem)

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and can be a source of morbidity and mortality. If this is suspected, a 12-lead EKG should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. Patients need evaluation for possible cardioversion, rate versus rhythm control, and anticoagulation. The first-line agent to achieve a target heart rate of <80 beats/min would be either a β-blocker or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. This patient has significant COPD, which eliminates the use of a nonselective β-blocker such as propranolol. A nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as verapamil or diltiazem would be a better choice. Adding digoxin could be considered if the initial therapy is unsuccessful in controlling the heart rate. Amiodarone has significant toxicity and is usually not recommended unless the first-line options fail.
