Limited internal rotation of the flexed hip

Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) typically occurs in young adolescents during the growth spurt,
when the femoral head is displaced posteriorly through the growth plate. Physical activity, obesity, and
male sex are predisposing factors for the development of this condition. There is pain with physical
activity, most commonly in the upper thigh anteriorly, but one-third of patients present with referred lower
thigh or knee pain, which can make accurate and timely diagnosis more difficult.
The hallmark of SCFE on examination is limited internal rotation of the hip. Specific to SCFE is the even
greater limitation of internal rotation when the hip is flexed to 90Â°. No other pediatric condition has this
physical finding, which makes the maneuver very useful in children with lower extremity pain. Orthopedic
consultation is advised if SCFE is suspected.
Hip extension and abduction are also limited in SCFE, but these findings are nonspecific. Displacement
of the patella is not associated with SCFE.
