Sarcoidosis

Many patients with uveitis have an associated systemic disease. Some medications may cause secondary
uveitis, and conditions such as ocular lymphoma and bloodborne infection may masquerade as primary
uveitis. In North America, the most common conditions associated with uveitis are the seronegative
spondyloarthropathies, sarcoidosis, syphilis, rheumatoid arthritis, and reactive arthritis. All of the
conditions listed may be associated with uveitis, but given the chest radiograph findings and clinical
scenario in this case, sarcoidosis is most likely.
