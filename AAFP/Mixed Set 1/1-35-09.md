He does not require screening now or in the future

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in men between the ages of 65 and 75 who have ever smoked (B recommendation). This should be performed one time, using abdominal duplex ultrasonography. There may be a small benefit for screening men who have never smoked, and the USPSTF recommends selectively offering screening to this group (C recommendation). The evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms in women who have ever smoked (I recommendation), and the USPSTF recommends against screening for women who have never smoked (D recommendation).
