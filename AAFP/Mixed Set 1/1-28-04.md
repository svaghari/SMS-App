Early mobilization as tolerated

Generally, the goal for patients with vertebral compression fractures is early mobilization when tolerated. Bed rest is ordered only if movement is not tolerated. The evidence for back bracing is limited but it can be used after weighing the risks and benefits. Current evidence supports initial conservative treatment before considering vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty (SOR C). Neurosurgical consultation is not required in this case.
