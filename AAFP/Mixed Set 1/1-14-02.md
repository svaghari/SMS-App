Assessing the patient’s motivation for change and determining where they are in the process

The Stages of Change Model assesses the patient’s motivation for change and determines which stage of
the change process the patient is in. The stages include precontemplation, contemplation, preparation,
action, and maintenance. Understanding this helps guide counseling strategies for each individual patient.
