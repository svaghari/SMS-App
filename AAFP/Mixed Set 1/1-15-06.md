Bupropion (Wellbutrin)

When psychogenic erectile dysfunction (ED) coexists with depression, treatment of the underlying mood
disorder is often an appropriate first step (SOR C). An antidepressant that is less likely to worsen the ED,
such as bupropion, mirtazapine, or fluvoxamine, should be chosen. Antidepressants that are more likely
to cause sexual side effects should be avoided, including SSRIs, SNRIs, and tricyclic and tetracyclic
antidepressants. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are the first line of treatment for ED (SOR A) and can be
used effectively in men with depression, in combination with treatments for mood disorders.
