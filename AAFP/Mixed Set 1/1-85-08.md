Acetaminophen orally

This child has had a simple febrile seizure, the most common seizure disorder of childhood. Treatment includes finding a source for the fever; this should include a lumbar puncture if meningitis is suspected. The most common infections associated with febrile seizures include viral upper respiratory infections, otitis media, and roseola. Antipyretics are the first-line treatment. Antibiotics are indicated only for appropriate treatment of underlying infections. Phenytoin and carbamazepine are ineffective for febrile seizures. Phenobarbital is sometimes used for prevention of recurrent febrile seizures, but is not indicated as an initial therapy. Only 30%â€“50% of children with an initial febrile seizure will have recurrent seizures. Ref: Behrman RE, Kliegman RM, Jenson HB (eds): Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, ed 17. Saunders, 2004, p 1994.
