Tinea capitis

Most tinea infections respond to topical therapy, but oral therapy is required for tinea capitis so that the drug will penetrate the hair shafts (SOR B). Tinea corporis may require oral therapy in severe cases, but usually responds to topical therapy (SOR A). Oral therapy has a higher likelihood of side effects. Erythrasma and mycosis fungoides are not fungal diseases. Ref: Andrews MD, Burns M: Common tinea infections in children. Am Fam Physician 2008;77(10):1415-1420.
