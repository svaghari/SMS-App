Ischemic heart disease

Cardiovascular disease, in particular ischemic heart disease, has now become the leading cause of human
deaths worldwide. It was once considered a disease of the wealthy, but now more than 80% of deaths from
noncommunicable diseases occur in low- to middle-income countries. The other conditions listed remain
among the top 10 causes of human deaths worldwide, along with stroke, lower respiratory infections,
COPD, diabetes mellitus, and road deaths.
