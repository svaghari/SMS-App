Fluticasone/salmeterol (Advair)

This patient has intermittent asthma that has become at least moderate persistent as defined by the frequency of her symptoms. The National Asthma Education and Prevention guidelines recommend a moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with a long-acting bronchodilator as the preferred treatment in moderate persistent asthma. Fluticasone/salmeterol at a dosage of 250/50 Î¼g is the only option that fits this category. Montelukast alone is an alternative treatment for mild persistent asthma (SOR A).
