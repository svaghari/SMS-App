Reassurance only

Febrile seizures occur in 2%–5% of children ≤5 years of age. Simple febrile seizures are characterized as being general, tonic-clonic, and less than 15 minutes in duration, and occur in patients with no prior history of neurologic disease. Prospective cohort studies support reassurance after a simple febrile seizure. Retrospective cohort studies fail to show a benefit from neuroimaging or electroencephalography. Two large case review studies showed no risk or a very low risk for meningitis in the absence of altered mental status or meningeal signs, so a lumbar puncture is not indicated. Randomized, controlled trials failed to show benefit and did show a potential side-effect risk from starting antiepileptic medication.
