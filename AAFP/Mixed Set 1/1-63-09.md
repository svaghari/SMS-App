Amiodarone (Cordarone)

Amiodarone is 37% iodine and is the most common source of iodine excess in the United States.
Excessive iodine intake from dietary sources, radiographic contrast media, or amiodarone increases the
production and release of thyroid hormone in iodine-deficient individuals and in older persons with
multinodular goiter. Additionally, like other medications such as interferon and interleukin-2, amiodarone
can trigger thyroiditis in patients with normal thyroid glands. These characteristics combine to induce
hyperthyroidism in slightly over 10% of patients treated with amiodarone.  -Blockers such as propranolol may be useful in controlling the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Methimazole and propylthiouracil interfere with organification of iodine, thereby suppressing thyroid hormone production; they are commonly used as antithyroid agents when treating hyperthyroidism. Research is ongoing to determine if methotrexate plus prednisone is an effective treatment for the ophthalmopathy associated with Gravesâ€™ hyperthyroidism.
