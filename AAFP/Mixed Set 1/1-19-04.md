She does not have a penicillin allergy and can use penicillin and its derivatives in the future

This patient was inadvertently challenged with amoxicillin and did not develop an allergic reaction. Her
demonstrated tolerance allows the future use of all penicillin antibiotics. Although a low-risk history allows
for an amoxicillin challenge in the clinic under medical observation, patients with moderate-risk histories
of an urticarial or other pruritic rash should undergo skin testing. If that testing is negative, it should be
followed with an amoxicillin challenge under observation. RAST testing is not indicated for penicillin
allergy testing.
