statin therapy, and repeat ultrasonography in 1 year

Asymptomatic carotid artery disease is considered a coronary artery disease risk equivalent; therefore,
statin therapy is indicated. Repeating ultrasonography annually to monitor for progression of the disease
and to guide intervention is also considered reasonable. According to the 2014 guidelines for the primary
prevention of stroke issued by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, prophylactic
carotid artery stenting might be considered in highly selected asymptomatic patients with >70% carotid
stenosis, but the effectiveness of this intervention compared with statin therapy alone is not well
established. The guidelines also state that it is reasonable to consider carotid endarterectomy for
asymptomatic patients with >70% stenosis if the risks of perioperative complications are low.
