CT of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous (IV) contrast

Evaluation of this patient should include CT of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous (IV) contrast. There is no reason to inquire about shellfish allergies prior to CT with IV contrast, because premedication is not needed. There is no correlation between shellfish allergies and allergic reactions to contrast. Patients with moderately severe to severe reactions to IV contrast in the past would need pretreatment with corticosteroids.
