Nonnutritive sweeteners are acceptable to use

Nonnutritive sweeteners contain few or no calories. According to the American Diabetes Association,
nonnutritive sweeteners may be acceptable to use instead of nutritive sweeteners such as sucrose. They
should be used in moderation if they are used.
The use of nonnutritive sweeteners can help to reduce overall intake of carbohydrates and calories. They
do not significantly affect glycemic control. Research is inconsistent regarding the effects of nonnutritive
sweeteners on weight loss, but most systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrate a benefit.
There is no recommendation to avoid sucralose or aspartame in patients with type 2 diabetes. Beverages
sweetened with sugar are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
