CT of the chest

While a plain chest radiograph should come first in the workup for hemoptysis, patients with normal radiographs who have a higher risk of malignancy (age 40 and a smoking history of 30 years) should undergo CT, usually with contrast. If CT is negative, pulmonary consultation and possible bronchoscopy should be pursued. Nasolaryngoscopy is not indicated if the initial history and examination do not indicate an upper airway source. Observation alone is not appropriate in patients with risk factors for malignancy.
