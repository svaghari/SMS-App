The history of gestational diabetes

A history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the greatest risk factor for future development of diabetes mellitus. It is thought that GDM unmasks an underlying propensity to diabetes. While a healthy pregnancy is a diabetogenic state, it is not thought to lead to future diabetes. This patient’s age is not a risk factor. Obesity and family history are risk factors for the development of diabetes, but having GDM leads to a fourfold greater risk of developing diabetes, independent of other risk factors (SOR C). It is thought that 5%–10% of women who have GDM will be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within 6 months of delivery. About 50% of women with a history of GDM will develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years of the affected pregnancy.
