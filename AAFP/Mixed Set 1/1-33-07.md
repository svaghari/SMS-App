A D-dimer level

Validated clinical prediction rules can be used to estimate the pretest probability of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism in a patient with dyspnea and chest pain, and to guide further evaluation (SOR C). Factors used for calculating the pretest probability include elevated heart rate without hemoptysis, a diagnosis of cancer, recent surgery/immobilization, previous thromboembolism, and signs and symptoms of DVT. Based on these rules the patient described in the scenario has a low score and therefore a low probability of pulmonary embolism.

A D-dimer level is the next most appropriate test for this low-probability scenario. Compression ultrasonography would be the next test for a patient with an intermediate or high pretest probability for DVT. CT angiography would be the next test for a clinically stable patient with an intermediate or high pretest probability of pulmonary embolism. A ventilation-perfusion scan would be the next test if a CT angiogram were indicated in a patient with a contraindication such as contrast allergy, renal disease, or pregnancy. Echocardiography would be the next test for a critically ill patient with a high pretest probability of pulmonary embolism.
