moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits

A “D” recommendation means the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against
the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms
outweigh the benefits. An “I” recommendation means the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is lacking,
of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. A “C”
recommendation means the USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to
individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate
certainty that the net benefit is small. A “B” recommendation means the USPSTF recommends the service.
There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit
is moderate to substantial. An “A” recommendation means the USPSTF recommends the service and there
is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial. The highest levels of evidence and most recent evidence
available are used by the USPSTF in making all of its recommendations.
