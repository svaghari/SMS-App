Gastric emptying scintigraphy

This patient has typical findings of gastroparesis, an autonomic neuropathy more commonly seen in type 1 diabetics and in women. The initial evaluation should include a patient history and examination, a CBC to rule out infection, a metabolic panel, endoscopy, and a biliary tract evaluation, but the diagnosis is best confirmed by scintigraphy. Pelvic ultrasonography and colonoscopy are not indicated because the patientâ€™s symptoms are upper intestinal. Cardiac evaluation and psychiatric consultation are not warranted with these symptoms.
