Vision or hearing impairment

Delirium occurs in 11%â€“42% of hospitalized patients. Risk factors for delirium in hospitalized patients
include vision impairment, hearing impairment, dehydration, immobility, cognitive impairment, and sleep
deprivation. Repeated reorientation of patients with cognitive impairment, early mobilization, and
minimizing unnecessary noise or stimulation are all effective interventions for reducing the risk of delirium
in hospitalized patients. Not having family members available at the time of admission has no effect on
the incidence of delirium.
