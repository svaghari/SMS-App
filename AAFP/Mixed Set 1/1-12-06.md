Placement of a thumb spica splint, with a follow-up examination in 2 weeks

The history, symptoms, and physical examination findings in this case suggest a scaphoid fracture. The
scaphoid bone is the most commonly fractured carpal bone and a fall on an outstretched hand can produce
enough force to cause this fracture. This fracture is most common in males 15–30 years of age.
The finding of anatomic snuffbox tenderness is highly sensitive but not specific for a scaphoid fracture.
Initial radiographs often do not demonstrate a fracture. When there is a high clinical suspicion for a
scaphoid fracture but radiographs are negative, it is reasonable to immobilize in a thumb spica splint and
reevaluate in 2 weeks.

Treatment for a sprain with or without follow-up would not be ideal in a situation where a scaphoid
fracture is suspected. MRI or bone scintigraphy can be considered if the patient desires or needs an
immediate diagnosis, but CT and ultrasonography are not appropriate imaging modalities for this fracture.
