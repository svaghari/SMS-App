Lung Cancer

Risk factors for progression from latent to active tuberculosis include lung cancer, diabetes mellitus,
alcoholism, recent contact with a person who has an active tuberculosis infection, any condition treated
with immunosuppressive therapy, and lung parenchymal diseases such as COPD, silicosis, or lung cancer.
The medically underserved and those in low-income groups are also more at risk of progression, as well
as children under age 5 and individuals weighing less than 90% of their ideal minimum body weight.
