Topical mupirocin (Bactroban)

The lesions described are nonbullous impetigo, due to either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Topical antibiotics, such as mupirocin, but not compounds containing neomycin, are the preferred first-line therapy for impetigo involving a limited area. Oral antibiotics are widely used, based on expert opinion and traditional practice, but are usually reserved for patients with more extensive impetigo or with systemic symptoms or signs. Penicillin V and hexachlorophene have both been shown to be no more effective than placebo. Topical antibiotics have been shown to be as effective as erythromycin, which has a common adverse effect of nausea.
