Breech presentation

Risk factors for developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants include a breech presentation in the third trimester, regardless of whether the delivery was cesarean or vaginal. Other indications to evaluate an infant for this condition include a positive family history, a history of previous clinical instability, parental concern, a history of improper swaddling, and a suspicious or inconclusive physical examination. Twin birth, a large-for-gestational age infant, and prematurity are not considered risk factors.
