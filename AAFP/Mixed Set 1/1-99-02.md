Laryngoscopy

Laryngoscopy should be performed to visualize the larynx and evaluate for vocal cord pathology in a patient whose hoarseness does not resolve within 3 months (SOR C). If a serious condition is suspected for some other reason, laryngoscopy should be performed regardless of the duration of symptoms. If there is a recent history of upper respiratory infection or vocal abuse, then it would be appropriate to recommend voice rest for 2 weeks. Laryngoscopy would then be indicated if the hoarseness did not improve or recurred after voice rest. For patients with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, a trial of a proton pump inhibitor is recommended (SOR B). Inhaled corticosteroids, especially fluticasone, may cause hoarseness. Oral corticosteroids do not have a role in the management of hoarseness.
