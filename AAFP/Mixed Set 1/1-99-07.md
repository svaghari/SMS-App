Bone pain

Multiple myeloma can be asymptomatic, but it becomes symptomatic when there is organ damage or other abnormalities, including renal insufficiency, elevated calcium, anemia, and bone disease.

The majority of patients have bone pain, but hypocalcemia is not common. Hypokalemia almost never occurs, and both hepatic failure and insomnia are not usual signs of multiple myeloma. Anemia typically occurs either because of renal failure or infiltration of the bone marrow by myeloma cells. Polycythemia does not occur.
