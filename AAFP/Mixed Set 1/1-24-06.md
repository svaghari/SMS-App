It decreases drug-resistant tuberculosis

In the treatment of active tuberculosis, direct observational therapy (DOT) involves providing the antituberculosis drugs directly to patients and watching them swallow the medication. It is the preferred care management strategy for all patients with tuberculosis. The use of DOT does not guarantee the ingestion of all doses of every medication, as patients may miss appointments, may not actually swallow the pills, or may regurgitate the medication, sometimes deliberately. Due to these limitations, the use of DOT does not remove the need to monitor patients for signs of treatment failure. DOT is effective in a wide variety of settings, including in the community with health nurses. It even shows benefit when the observation makes use of telehealth settings or mobile phones.

Among the important benefits of DOT are that it has been shown to decrease both the acquisition and transmission of drug-resistant tuberculosis and to increase treatment success in HIV-positive patients.
