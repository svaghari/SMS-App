Accepted mood stabilizers used for maintenance therapy in patients with bipolar disorder include lithium, valproate, lamotrigine, and some atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. The atypical antipsychotics are associated with weight gain and adverse metabolic changes. Annual testing for diabetes mellitus is recommended. Long-term maintenance therapy with a mood stabilizer is recommended in patients with bipolar I disorder due to the high risk of recurrent mania. Monotherapy with antidepressants is contraindicated. Although the typical antipsychotics may cause QT
prolongation, atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine do so much less frequently, and most SSRIs do not cause this. Coadministration with sertraline is not contraindicated.
