Elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and elevated phosphorus

Chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is found in many patients with CKD and
is associated with an increased risk of bone fractures and cardiovascular events due to vascular
calcification. In patients with CKD, phosphate is not appropriately excreted and the subsequent
hyperphosphatemia leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism and binding of calcium. Decreased production
of calcitriol in patients with CKD also leads to hypocalcemic hyperparathyroidism. Patients with CKD
stages 3a–5 should have phosphorus, calcium, parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels
checked regularly, and consultation with a nephrologist or endocrinologist should be obtained if
CKD-MBD is suspected.
