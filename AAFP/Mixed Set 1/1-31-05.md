Noncontrast chest CT in 1 year

By definition, a pulmonary nodule is a circumscribed, round lesion that may measure up to 3 cm in size and is surrounded by aerated lung. Management is based on the size of the nodule and the probability of malignancy. Risk factors for lung cancer include a previous malignancy, a positive smoking history, and age â‰¥65. Only 1% of nodules between 2 mm and 5 mm in size are malignant.

Nodules <8 mm are difficult to biopsy, and a PET scan is not reliable. The risk of surgery outweighs the benefits in nodules of this size. For a low-risk patient with a nodule 4 mm to <6 mm in size, a repeat noncontrast CT at 12 months is recommended. If it is unchanged, no further follow-up is needed.
