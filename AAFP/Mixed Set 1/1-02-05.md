Elevated urine osmolality

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD, formerly SIADH) is related to a variety of pulmonary and central nervous system disorders in which hyponatremia and hypo-osmolality are paradoxically associated with an inappropriately concentrated urine. Most cases are associated with increased levels of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). Making a diagnosis of SIAD requires that the patient be euvolemic and has not taken diuretics within the past 24â€“48 hours, and the urine osmolality must be high in conjunction with both low serum sodium and low osmolality. The BUN should be normal or low and the fractional excretion of sodium >1%.

Fluid restriction (<800 cc/24 hrs) over several days will correct the hyponatremia/hypo-osmolality, but definitive treatment requires eliminating the underlying cause, if possible. In the case of severe, acute hyponatremia with symptoms such as confusion, obtundation, or seizures, hypertonic (3%) saline can be slowly infused intravenously but might have dangerous neurologic side effects.

Elevated serum glucose levels may cause a factitious hyponatremia, but not SIAD.
