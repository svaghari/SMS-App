At least 12 months

Dual antiplatelet therapy should extend beyond 1 year for patients with acute coronary syndrome who are not considered at high risk of bleeding, especially those with risk factors associated with high ischemic risk such as diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery disease, left main stenting, or a history of a cardiovascular event. For dual antiplatelet therapy that continues beyond a year, either ticagrelor, 60 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel, 75 mg daily, is recommended in addition to aspirin. The patientâ€™s bleeding and ischemic risk should be reevaluated at least annually.
Dual antiplatelet therapy should continue for at least 1 year in patients who are considered at high risk of bleeding. For patients who are at very high risk of bleeding or who experience significant bleeding while on dual antiplatelet therapy, a duration of less than 1 year is recommended.
