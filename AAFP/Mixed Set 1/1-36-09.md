Intravenous iron replacement

This patient has symptomatic iron deficiency anemia. Because she has had a gastric bypass, she is not able to absorb iron adequately and therefore needs intravenous iron replacement. A blood transfusion may help temporarily but will not restore her iron stores, so it is not indicated. She will not absorb oral iron adequately. If she does not respond to intravenous iron, consultation with a hematologist may be indicated.
