75

Although national guidelines vary, it is generally advised to start routine colon cancer screening between ages 45 and 50, and to screen with a more individualized approach between ages 75 and 85. Factors to consider include life expectancy, the patientâ€™s overall health, whether the patient has been screened previously, and patient preference. Most guidelines recommend stopping colon cancer screening in patients older than 85 years or when their life expectancy falls below 10 years (SOR B).
