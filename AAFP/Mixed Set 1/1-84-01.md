Zoledronic acid (Reclast)

There are a number of alternatives to the bisphosphonates. Unfortunately, efficacy data is not encouraging for most of them. Intravenous zoledronic acid has been shown to reduce both hip fracture risk and vertebral fracture risk. Teriparatide reduces vertebral fracture risk but not hip fracture risk. The same is true for raloxifene and calcitonin salmon.
