Sertraline (Zoloft)

Results of randomized clinical trials demonstrate that medications such as SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors alleviate the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and are associated with improvements in overall functioning. SSRIs are a first-line medication because they are safer and better tolerated than other types of psychotropic medications. Sertraline and paroxetine are the only agents that have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD. Ref: Yehuda R: Post-traumatic stress disorder. N Engl J Med 2002;346(2):108-114.
