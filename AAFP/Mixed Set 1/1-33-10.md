Revascularization

Medication and/or a walking program have been shown to improve functional capacity in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, this patient has critical limb ischemia and needs urgent revascularization. Endovascular therapy of isolated disease below the knee is not recommended. These patients should undergo femoral-tibial bypass. Warfarin is not recommended for the treatment of PAD.
