Order blood work taken from a peripheral vein

Physicians should avoid reacting to laboratory values without considering the clinical scenario.  This patient presented with mild dehydration and normal laboratory values.  Although he is improving clinically, his laboratory values show multiple unexpected results.  The most noticeable is the severely elevated glucose, because he has no history of diabetes mellitus or use of medications that could cause this effect.  Similarly, the elevated potassium and decreased sodium suggest profound electrolyte abnormalities.  Most likely, the laboratory technician drew blood from the patients indwelling port without discarding the first several milliliters.  Thus, the blood was contaminated with intravenous fluids, resulting in the erroneous results.  A repeat blood test from a peripheral vein should give more accurate results.
