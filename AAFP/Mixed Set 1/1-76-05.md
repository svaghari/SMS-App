An acidic environment enhances the absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract

Oral iron is absorbed better with an acidic gastric environment, which can be accomplished with the concomitant administration of vitamin C.  Agents that raise gastric pH, such as antacids, proton pump inhibitors, and H2 blockers, should be avoided if possible.  Oral iron absorption is improved if the iron is taken on an empty stomach, but this may not be well tolerated because gastric irritation is a frequent side effect.  Constipation also is common with oral iron therapy.  Iron therapy should be continued for several months after the hemoglobin reaches a normal level, in order to fully replenish iron stores.  Sustained-release oral iron products provide a decreased amount of iron for absorption. Ref: Killip S, Bennett JM, Chambers MD: Iron deficiency anemia. Am Fam Physician 2007;75(5):671-678.
