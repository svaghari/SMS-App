An enuresis alarm

Enuresis alarms should be offered as initial treatment for bed-wetting, based on randomized, controlled trials and cost-effectiveness evidence. Desmopressin can also be considered if the child or parents do not want to try an alarm. Restriction of fluids during the day should not be recommended, as it is important that children have enough to drink. Waking a child and carrying him or her to the toilet has not been shown to have a long-term effect on bed-wetting. Oxybutynin and imipramine should only be considered in cases where bed-wetting does not respond to initial treatment.
