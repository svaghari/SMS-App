often believe they are somehow responsible for the death

Children from the ages of 2 to 6 often believe they are somehow responsible for the death of a loved one. The emotional pain may be so intense that the child may react by denying the death, or may somehow feel that the death is reversible. If children wish to attend a funeral, or if their parents want them to, they should be accompanied by an adult who can provide comfort and support. Telling a child the loved one is asleep or that he or she “went away” usually creates false hopes for return, or it may foster a sleep phobia.
