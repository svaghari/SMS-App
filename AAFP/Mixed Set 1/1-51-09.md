Serum ferritin

Mild asymptomatic elevations (<5 times the upper limit of normal) of ALT and AST are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. The initial evaluation should include assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Waist circumference, blood pressure, a fasting lipid level, and a fasting glucose level or hemoglobin A1c should be obtained. A CBC with platelets and measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin levels would also be indicated. Iron studies should be ordered to rule out hereditary hemochromatosis, which is an autosomal recessive disease that causes increased iron absorption in the intestines and release by tissue macrophages.
