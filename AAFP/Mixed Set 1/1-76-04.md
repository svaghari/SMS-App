10 years

Risk factors for proximal neoplasia include high-grade dysplasia, three or more adenomas, adenomas with villous features, and an adenoma â‰¥1 cm in size.  For patients with one or more of these findings, follow-up colonoscopy in 3 years is recommended.  The clinical benefit of follow-up surveillance colonoscopy in patients with one or two small adenomas has never been demonstrated.  Distal hyperplastic polyps are not markers for proximal or advanced neoplasia.  Patients with this finding on colonoscopy should be considered to have a normal colonoscopy and the interval until the next colonoscopy should be 10 years.
