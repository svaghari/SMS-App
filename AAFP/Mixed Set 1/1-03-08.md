Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common primary cardiomyopathy, with a prevalence of 1:500 persons. Many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are asymptomatic and are diagnosed during family screening, by auscultation of a heart murmur, or incidentally after an abnormal result on electrocardiography. On examination physicians may hear a systolic murmur that increases in intensity during Valsalva maneuvers. The main goals of therapy are to decrease exertional dyspnea and chest pain and prevent sudden cardiac death. β-Blockers are the initial therapy for patients with symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil can be used if β-blockers are not well tolerated.
