Renal disease

The most common cause of hypoglycemia in a previously stable, well-controlled diabetic patient who has not changed his or her diet or insulin dosage is diabetic renal disease. A reduction in physical activity or the appearance of insulin antibodies (unlikely after 20 years of therapy) would increase insulin requirements and produce hyperglycemia. Spontaneous improvement β -cell function after 20 years would be very rare.
