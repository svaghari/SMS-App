Hypochloremic alkalosis

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. If it is allowed to progress untreated, there may be signs of malnutrition, constipation, oliguria, and profound hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. The latter is a characteristic sign of pyloric obstruction. As the child vomits chloride and hydrogen-rich gastric contents, hypochloremic alkalosis sets in. Pneumonia is not a common problem with pyloric stenosis, as it can be with congenital tracheoesophageal fistulae for example. After feeding, there may be a visible peristaltic wave that progresses across the abdomen. However, since the point of obstruction is proximal to the small and large intestines and affected infants lose weight, the abdomen is usually flat rather than distended, especially in the malnourished infant. Currant jelly stool is a common clinical manifestation of intussusception. Mild jaundice with elevated indirect bilirubin is seen in about 5% of infants with pyloric stenosis, but is not a characteristic sign. Ref: Bland KI, Sarr MG (ed): The Practice of General Surgery.
