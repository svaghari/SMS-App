Nystagmus when vertigo is elicited

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) originates in the posterior semicircular canal in the majority of patients (85%–95% range reported). The Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which involves moving the patient from an upright to a supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and the neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, will elicit a specific series of responses in these patients. Following a latency period that typically lasts 5–20 seconds but sometimes as long as 60 seconds, the patient will experience the onset of rotational vertigo. The objective finding of a torsional, upbeating nystagmus will be associated with the vertigo. The vertigo and nystagmus typically increase in intensity and then resolve within 1 minute from onset.
