Canagliflozin (Invokana) instead of glipizide

Given the obesity epidemic in the United States, an awareness of therapies that affect weight is imperative for family physicians. This patient is taking medications that help with weight loss (metformin) and medications that are weight neutral (lisinopril, simvastatin, and fluoxetine). Glipizide, however, causes weight gain, and switching to an SLGT2 inhibitor such as canagliflozin can help promote weight loss. Likewise, the patient could use a GLP-1 receptor agonist such as exenatide or an amylin mimetic (pramlintide) for weight loss benefits. Sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and insulins all promote weight gain (SOR A).

Fluoxetine and sertraline are weight neutral, whereas paroxetine can cause weight gain (SOR B). The statins are weight neutral in general, and switching to atorvastatin should not affect weight. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, thiazides, and Î²-adrenergic blockers are all weight neutral. In this patient with diabetes mellitus, an ACE inhibitor would be preferable to carvedilol in terms of renal protection (SOR A).
