A helical CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast

An unenhanced helical CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is the best study for confirming the diagnosis of a urinary tract stone in a patient with acute flank pain, supplanting the former gold standard, intravenous pyelography. A CT scan may also reveal other pathology, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or abdominal aortic aneurysm. Although abdominal ultrasonography has a very high specificity, it is still not better than CT, and its sensitivity is much lower; thus, its use is usually confined to pregnant patients with a suspected stone. Plain abdominal radiographs may show the stone if it is radiopaque, and are useful for following patients with radiopaque stones. CT will reveal a radiopaque stone. While most patients with stones will have hematuria, its absence does not rule out a stone. Ref: Teichman JM: Acute renal colic from ureteral calculus. N Engl J Med 2004;350(7):684-693.
