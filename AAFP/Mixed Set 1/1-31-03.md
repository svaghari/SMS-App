A radiograph of the left hip

A fractured hip is possible and must be ruled out since there is difficulty bearing weight and the leg is externally rotated. Examination of a patient with severe dementia can be extremely difficult. Other findings with a fractured hip would include pain elicited on rotation and groin pain when applying an axial load. If the hip radiograph is negative, MRI of the knee may be considered.
