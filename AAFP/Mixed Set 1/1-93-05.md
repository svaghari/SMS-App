Serum antibody tests are sensitive and specific

Celiac disease is thought to be greatly underdiagnosed in the United States. Antibody tests indicate that the prevalence is approximately 1:250 among adult Americans of European ancestry. Approximately 7% of type 1 diabetics have celiac disease. A number of other autoimmune syndromes have been associated with celiac disease, including thyroid disease and rheumatoid arthritis. There is no reported association with type 2 diabetes. Gastrointestinal involvement may manifest as diarrhea, constipation, or other symptoms of malabsorption, such as bloating, flatus, or belching. Fatigue, depression, fibromyalgia-like symptoms, aphthous stomatitis, bone pain, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux, and other nonspecific symptoms may be present and can make the diagnosis quite challenging. Dermatitis herpetiformis is seen in 10% of patients with celiac disease. Serum antibody testing, especially IgA antiendomysial antibody, is highly sensitive and specific and readily available at a cost of about $100 to $200. Definitive diagnosis generally requires esophagogastroduodenoscopy with a biopsy of the distal duodenum to detect characteristic villous flattening.
