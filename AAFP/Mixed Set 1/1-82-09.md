Famciclovir (Famvir)

The key indicator of postherpetic neuralgia is persistent pain 3–6 months after an episode of herpes zoster. Studies show that patients who present for treatment of herpes zoster within 72 hours will benefit from antiviral therapy such as famciclovir to reduce the pain and decrease the risk of postherpetic neuralgia. Treating zoster pain with tricyclic antidepressants in low dosage (10–25 mg amitriptyline) may also decrease risk. While steroids added to antiviral therapy may be of benefit in short-term therapy, they do not reduce pain at 6 months. Ref: Ustaine R: Postherpetic neuralgia. CME Bulletin.
