An over-the-counter oral rehydration solution

When children show signs of dehydration from diarrhea, the first step is to assess its extent. In one study, four factors predicted dehydration: a capillary refill time >2 seconds, the absence of tears, dry mucous membranes, and an ill general appearance; the presence of two or more of these signs indicates a fluid deficit of at least 5%. This child has two of the signs, but does not require intravenous fluids at this point. Early oral rehydration therapy is recommended and can be started at home. This should be done using an oral rehydration solution that is designed for children (SOR C). Adult oral rehydration solutions should not be used in children.

Water and other clear liquids, even those with sodium, such as chicken broth, should not replace an oral rehydration solution because they are hyperosmolar. These fluids do not adequately replace potassium, bicarbonate, or sodium, and can sometimes cause hyponatremia. Antidiarrheal medications are usually not recommended for use in children with acute gastroenteritis because they delay the elimination of infectious agents from the intestines.
