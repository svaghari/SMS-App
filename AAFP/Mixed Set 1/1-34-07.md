Hydrochlorothiazide

The 2014 evidence-based guideline from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) makes few suggestions regarding preferred initial agents for the treatment of hypertension. Of the options listed, only hydrochlorothiazide is a reasonable option for first-line treatment. Verapamil is rarely used for blood pressure control.
