Alcoholic liver disease

An AST (SGOT) to ALT (SGPT) ratio greater than 2:1 suggests alcoholic liver disease, and a ratio of 3:1 or higher is highly suggestive of alcoholic liver disease. With most hepatocellular disorders, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, and iron overload disorder, the patient will have an AST to ALT ratio <1.
