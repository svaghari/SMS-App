Transvaginal ultrasonography

Transvaginal ultrasonography is the preferred initial test for a patient with painless postmenopausal
bleeding, although endometrial biopsy is an option if transvaginal ultrasonography is not available.
Transvaginal ultrasonography showing an endometrial thickness <3–4 mm would essentially rule out
endometrial carcinoma (SOR C). An endometrial biopsy is invasive and has low sensitivity for focal
lesions. Saline infusion hysterography should be considered if the endometrial thickness is greater than the
threshold, or if an adequate measurement cannot be obtained by ultrasonography. If hysterography shows
a global process, then a histologic diagnosis can usually be obtained with an endometrial biopsy, but if a
focal lesion is present hysteroscopy should be considered as the next diagnostic step. Colposcopy is not
indicated given the patient’s normal Papanicolaou smear.
