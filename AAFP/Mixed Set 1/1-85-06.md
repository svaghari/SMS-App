The patient is pregnant

The failure to provide immunizations because of perceived contraindications is one of the most common reasons for an inadequately protected population. A PPD may be falsely negative if administered 2-30 days after MMR administration, not the reverse. If the patient is immunodeficient or pregnant, rather than a household contact, then MMR is contraindicated. Breastfeeding is not a contraindication.
