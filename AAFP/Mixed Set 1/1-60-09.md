Nasogastric fluids

The mainstay of therapy for acute respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis is supportive care, and maintaining hydration is important. Infants with respiratory rates >60/min may have poor feeding secondary to difficulty breathing and oral rehydration may increase the risk of aspiration. In these cases, nasogastric or intravenous fluids should be administered. Oxygen saturation of 90% or more on room air is sufficient for infants with bronchiolitis, and using supplemental oxygen to maintain higher oxygen saturations only prolongs hospitalization because of an assumed need for oxygen. Bronchodilators should not be administered to infants with bronchiolitis, because they have not been shown to have any effect on the need for hospitalization, oxygen saturation, or disease resolution. In addition, there is no evidence to support the use of epinephrine or corticosteroids in the inpatient setting.
