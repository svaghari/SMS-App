Stroke

The conditions listed are all causes of seizures. Of course, there are many other causes of seizures in the elderly, including primary and metastatic neoplasias (e.g., electrolyte disorders). However, in the geriatric population, cerebrovascular disease is the most common cause of seizures, with about 10% of stroke victims developing epileptic seizures. Seizures are more common following hemorrhagic strokes compared to nonhemorrhagic strokes. Ref: Hazzard WR, Blass JP, Halter JB, et al (eds): Principles of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology, ed 5.
