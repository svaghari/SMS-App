Warm compresses and gentle cleansing with a mild shampoo

This patient has blepharitis, a chronic inflammation of the eyelids. Seborrhea is a common cause in older
adults. In younger patients including children, colonization with Staphylococcus may be a contributing
factor. Meibomian gland dysfunction is often part of this condition, contributing to a reduced quality of
tear films, which leads to dry eyes and irritation. Other diagnoses to consider in this patient include
conjunctivitis, preseptal cellulitis, and Sjögren’s syndrome. Conjunctivitis typically involves the
conjunctiva and an eye discharge but less involvement of the eyelids is present. Cellulitis is an acute rather
than chronic condition and involves more pain and swelling. Sjögren’s syndrome causes dry eye but not
inflammatory changes of the lid.
The initial treatment of blepharitis consists of lid hygiene using warm compresses to remove dried
secretions and debris. Mild shampoo can help in this process and aid in keeping the bacterial colonization
load down. In severe or recalcitrant cases a topical antibiotic ointment may be applied to the lids. Oral
antibiotics can be considered for more severe cases.
