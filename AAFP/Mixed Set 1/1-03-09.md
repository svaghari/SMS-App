Aripiprazole (Abilify)

Nonpharmacologic interventions are the first-line treatment for patients with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Antipsychotic medications can be prescribed for refractory cases but this is an off-label use. Both the patient and family should be aware that the use of atypical antipsychotics for behavioral symptoms of dementia is associated with increased mortality. Patients should be monitored for side effects and the medication should be discontinued if there is no evidence of symptom improvement after a month.

Typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol have significant side effects and would not be a good choice. Donepezil is initiated early in the course of Alzheimerâ€™s disease to delay progression of the disease. Benzodiazepines are likely to cause significant side effects including sedation, increased confusion, and falls. Several of the antipsychotics, such as ziprasidone and clozapine, are ineffective. Results with olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone are inconsistent. Aripiprazole produces small reductions in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and it has the least adverse effects of the atypical antipsychotics.
