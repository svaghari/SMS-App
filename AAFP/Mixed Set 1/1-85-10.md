Intranasal decongestants

Intranasal decongestants such as phenylephrine should not be used for more than 3 days, as they cause rebound congestion on drug withdrawal. When used for several months or more, these agents can cause a form of rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, that can be extremely difficult to treat.
