The number needed to treat (NNT) is defined as the number of people who would need to receive an intervention in order for one person to benefit. It is the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). The ARR is the difference in risk for a disease without and with an intervention. The correct formula for calculating NNT is 1/ARR.
