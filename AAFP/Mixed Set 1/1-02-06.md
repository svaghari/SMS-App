Chlorthalidone

Lifestyle modifications addressing diet, physical activity, and weight are important in the treatment of hypertension, particularly for African-American and Hispanic patients. When antihypertensive drugs are also required, the best options may vary according to the racial and ethnic background of the patient. The presence or absence of comorbid conditions is also important to consider. For African-Americans, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers, both as monotherapy and as a component in multidrug regimens, have been shown to be more effective in lowering blood pressure than ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or Î²-blockers, and should be considered as first-line options over the other classes of antihypertensive drugs unless a comorbid condition is present that would be better addressed with a different class of drugs. Racial or ethnic background should not be the basis for the exclusion of any drug class when multidrug regimens are required to reach treatment goals.
