Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)

This patient has findings consistent with influenza, including a rapid onset of fever, nausea, and sore throat, and negative pulmonary findings. Influenza is considered a clinical diagnosis and confirmation of the diagnosis with laboratory testing is not required. Treatment of influenza is recommended for individuals at a high risk of influenza-related complications. High-risk individuals include those with chronic lung disease; cardiovascular (excluding hypertension), renal, hepatic, hematologic, or neurologic disease; or age >65. Children on long-term aspirin therapy, and pregnant and postpartum women are also considered high risk. This patient should be treated with antiviral medication because of his chronic pulmonary disease. While pneumonia and streptococcal pharyngitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis, these are less likely given the examination findings, and antibiotics are not recommended. Prednisone is not indicated for influenza-like illness and may cause harm.
