Perform a methacholine challenge

Spirometry is central to confirming the diagnosis of asthma, which is characterized by a reversible
obstructive pattern of pulmonary function. In this case the patient’s FEV1/FVC ratio is normal, which
neither confirms nor rules out asthma. A methacholine challenge is recommended in this scenario to assess
for the airway hyperresponsiveness that is the hallmark of asthma. Methacholine is a cholinergic agonist.
Bronchoconstriction (defined as a reduction in FEV1 20%) observed at low levels of methacholine
administration (<4 mg/mL) is consistent with asthma. If the FEV1/FVC ratio is reduced on initial
spirometry, a bronchodilator response should be tested. A fixed or partially reversible obstructive pattern
suggests an alternative diagnosis such as COPD, and full reversal after bronchodilator use is consistent
with asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids are not appropriate for intermittent asthma.
