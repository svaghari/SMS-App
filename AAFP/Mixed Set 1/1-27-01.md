Autism spectrum disorder

Key diagnostic features of autism spectrum disorder include deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. The DSM-5 , which came out in 2013, created an umbrella diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder to consolidate four previously separate disorders: autistic disorder, Aspergerâ€™s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Any individuals with a previous diagnosis of one of these disorders should now be given a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.
