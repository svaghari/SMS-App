β-Blockers

β-Blockers are recommended to reduce mortality in symptomatic patients with heart failure (SOR A). The role that digoxin will ultimately play in heart failure is unclear. The Digitalis Investigation Group study revealed a trend toward increased mortality among women with heart failure who were taking digoxin, but digoxin levels were higher among women than men. There is no evidence that warfarin decreases mortality in patients with heart failure. There is also no evidence that amiodarone decreases mortality from heart failure in patients with no history of atrial fibrillation. Calcium channel blockers should be used with caution in patients with heart failure because they can cause peripheral vasodilation, decreased heart rate, decreased cardiac contractility, and decreased cardiac conduction.
