A smooth philtrum

The classic facial dysmorphologies associated with fetal alcohol syndrome are a smooth philtrum,
shortened palpebral fissures, and a thin vermilion border of the upper lip. Two out of these three
characteristics are required for the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. Low-set ears and a central chin
dimple are not associated findings.
