Thyroidectomy

This patient has a medical history, physical examination, and radioactive iodine uptake scan consistent with
toxic multinodular goiter, which is the second most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States.
Although the addition of propranolol and an increase in methimazole may control her palpitations and other
symptoms of hyperthyroidism, these measures will not permanently eliminate the problem. Radioactive
iodine ablation and thyroidectomy with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement are both appropriate
treatments for toxic multinodular goiter, but thyroidectomy is indicated for this patient because she has
compressive symptoms from the goiter itself.
