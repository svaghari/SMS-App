RBC casts in the urine

Acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) in children manifests as brown or cola-colored urine, which may be painless or associated with mild flank or abdominal pain. There are many etiologies of AGN but the most common in children are IgA nephropathy (which may directly follow an acute upper respiratory tract infection) and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis following a streptococcal throat or skin infection (usually 7â€“21 days later). In cases with more severe renal involvement, patients may develop hypertension, edema, and oliguria. RBC casts are the classic finding on urinalysis in a patient with AGN. WBC casts are seen in acute pyelonephritis, often manifested by high fever, and costovertebral angle or flank pain and tenderness. Patients may also appear septic. Positive serum antinuclear antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis. Urine eosinophils are seen in drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis. Serum complement levels are reduced, not elevated, in various forms of acute glomerulopathies, including poststreptococcal AGN.
