Oral contraceptives

Melasma is a progressive, macular, nonscaling hypermelanosis of skin exposed to the sun, typically involving the face and dorsal forearms. It is often associated with pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives or anticonvulsants (SOR C). Some melasma is idiopathic. Women are nine times more likely to be affected than men, and darker-skinned individuals are also at greater risk. There are three common patterns of melasma: centrofacial, malar, and mandibular.
