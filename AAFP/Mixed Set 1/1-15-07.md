He should receive one dose of the vaccine now and no additional HPV vaccine in the future

HPV vaccine is currently recommended for males and females at age 11. Catch-up vaccination is
recommended until age 21 in males and 26 in females. Children who receive the first dose of the vaccine
before the age of 15 and receive two doses are considered adequately vaccinated. If the first dose is given
after age 15, a three-dose series is recommended.
