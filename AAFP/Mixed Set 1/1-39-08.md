Fine-needle aspiration

This patient is at high risk for malignancy based on his age, sex, and lymphadenopathy for more than 4â€“6 weeks. Fine-needle aspiration is an acceptable first-line test to evaluate for a reactive node versus malignancy. Further testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Watchful waiting could delay the diagnosis of a malignancy in a patient at high risk and would not be appropriate. Due to the duration of his symptoms and presentation, lymphadenitis is unlikely and antibiotics would not be appropriate. Corticosteroids are not recommended until a diagnosis is confirmed, as they may interfere with the cytology. While medications can cause lymphadenopathy, lisinopril has not been associated with this problem.
