Cardiac event monitoring

This patient’s EKG demonstrates a right bundle branch block, as well as a left anterior hemiblock. This “trifascicular block” puts the patient at risk for tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias. Given the patient’s complaint of near-syncope, a heart monitoring study would be most appropriate. An echocardiogram may be helpful eventually to assess cardiac function. Although the patient is at risk for heart block, immediate hospitalization is not indicated.
