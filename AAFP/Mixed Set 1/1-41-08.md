Alcohol use

Alcohol consumption greater than one drink/day has been associated with atrial fibrillation. While not recommended to prevent atrial fibrillation, pioglitazone and lisinopril have both been associated with lower rates of atrial fibrillation compared to alternative therapies. Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, along with a regular fitness regimen, has been associated with a decrease in the recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
