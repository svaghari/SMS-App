has easy access to firearms

Easy access to a lethal means of suicide is a major risk factor for a successful suicide attempt. It is
important to eliminate access to firearms, drugs, or toxins for a patient with any suicidal ideation. Other
risk factors include, but are not limited to, a family history of suicide, previous suicide attempts, a history
of mental disorders, a history of alcohol or substance abuse, and physical illness. Another risk factor in
this patient is loss of a personal relationship. A history of borderline personality disorder (associated with
cutting) is not a risk for successful suicide. Any support from family or friends is helpful, even if it is
limited.
