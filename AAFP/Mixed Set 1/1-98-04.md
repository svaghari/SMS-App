Calcium phosphate

Urine pH is an important factor in the production of kidney stones. Uric acid, cystine, and calcium oxalate stones tend to form in acidic urine, whereas struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) and calcium phosphate stones form in alkaline urine. Urine should be acidified for prevention of calcium phosphate and struvite stones. Cranberry juice or betaine can lower urine pH.
