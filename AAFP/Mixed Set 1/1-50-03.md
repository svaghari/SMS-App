Follow-up in 6–12 months

This patient’s history and the examination support the diagnosis of adolescent physiologic gynecomastia. The most appropriate next step is follow-up with this patient in 6–12 months. One-half of all adolescent males will experience some form of gynecomastia. This condition is often bilateral, but it is more common on the left side if it is unilateral. It will typically resolve 6–24 months after onset. Patients should be asked about medications and supplements, because these may be a cause of nonphysiologic breast enlargement. Concerning factors include persistence for longer than 2 years; hard, immobile, nontender masses; masses >5 cm; nipple discharge; testicular masses; and systemic symptoms such as weight loss. Evaluation for persistent gynecomastia can include laboratory studies to exclude hepatic, renal, and thyroid disorders, and can progress to include tests to detect gonadotropin and hormone-related tumors and disorders. Imaging and/or a biopsy would be indicated if signs of a carcinoma were noted. The additional options listed are not indicated at this point, although they are a part of the recommended algorithm for further evaluation and treatment considerations.
