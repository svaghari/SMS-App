Referral for aortic valve replacement

This patient has severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. The only therapy shown to improve symptoms and mortality in such patients is an aortic valve replacement. In patients with asymptomatic disease, watchful waiting is usually the recommended course of action. No medications or other therapies have been shown to prevent disease progression or alleviate symptoms. Patients with coexisting hypertension should be managed medically according to accepted guidelines. Diuretics should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce left ventricular filling and cardiac output, which leads to an increase in symptoms.
