Increase prednisone to 15 mg daily and continue fludrocortisone at the current dosage

Patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency, either primary or secondary, may not be able to mount a stress
response to infection or surgical procedures. Common practice during minor infections is to increase the
corticosteroid supplementation (SOR C). Fludrocortisone should be continued, but stress dosing is not
necessary.
