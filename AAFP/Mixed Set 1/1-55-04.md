sensorineural hearing loss

Although tinnitus is idiopathic, sensorineural hearing loss is the most common identified cause. It can also be caused by other otologic, vascular, neoplastic, neurologic, pharmacologic, dental, and psychological factors. Almost all patients with tinnitus should undergo audiometry with tympanometry, and some patients require neuroimaging or assessment of vestibular function with electronystagmography. Counseling may also improve the chances of successful subsequent treatment. Several medications can cause tinnitus, but allopurinol is not one of them.
