Ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, plus azithromycin (Zithromax), 1 g orally

The recommended treatment regimen for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly. The 125-mg regimen is no longer recommended because of treatment failures and limited effectiveness in pharyngeal infections. In addition, the patient should be given azithromycin, 1 g orally, because of the high incidence of coinfection with Chlamydia, even if testing is negative, and to decrease the risk for cephalosporin resistance.
