Surgery

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is stable slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). This is more frequent in males than in females, and is more common in African-Americans and Pacific Islanders than in whites. Although some patients present with pain, many present with a painless limp or vague pain. The average age of onset is 13.5 years for males and 12 years for females. Obesity is strongly associated with SCFE.
The lack of systemic symptoms makes osteomyelitis, abscess, or a septic joint much less likely. Malignancy is a possibility, but night pain would be more likely. Sacroiliitis is much less likely given a negative FABER test. The patient’s age makes transient synovitis or Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease less likely. Although muscle strain is a possibility, the physical examination findings of external rotation deformity and limited internal rotation are more specific for SCFE.
Once the diagnosis of SCFE is made, the patient should not bear weight and should be referred promptly for surgery to prevent complications.
