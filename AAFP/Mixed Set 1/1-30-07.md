7.0 g/dL

In otherwise healthy stable patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, a transfusion of red cells is recommended when the hemoglobin level falls below 7.0 g/dL. In hypotensive patients with severe bleeding, a blood transfusion before the hemoglobin level reaches 7.0 g/dL is needed to prevent significant decreases below this level that would occur with just fluid resuscitation. In hemodynamically stable patients with known cardiovascular disease and significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 8.0 g/dL should be the threshold for a blood transfusion.
