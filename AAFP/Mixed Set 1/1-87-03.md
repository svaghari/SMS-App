Moxifloxacin (Avelox)

When trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated, a 3-day course of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, or gatifloxacin is a reasonable alternative. Moxifloxacin attains inadequate urinary concentrations and should not be used in the management of urinary tract infections. Ref: Fihn SD: Acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women.
