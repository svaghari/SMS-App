Liraglutide (Victoza)

Liraglutide, exenatide, and dulaglutide are all GLP-1 receptor agonists. Of these, only liraglutide has been shown to lower the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and has received FDA approval for this indication. Glipizide (a sulfonylurea), rosiglitazone, and sitagliptin have not been associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. Empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, has also been associated with secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
