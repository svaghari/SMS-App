Add amlodipine (Norvasc)

First-line agents for hypertension include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. Hydrochlorothiazide would be relatively contraindicated due to the patient’s gout. Losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, should not be added because the patient is taking an ACE inhibitor. Metoprolol succinate, a β-blocker, is not a first-line agent for blood pressure unless there is another indication such as systolic heart failure or migraine prophylaxis.
