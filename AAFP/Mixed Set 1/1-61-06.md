Bupropion (Wellbutrin)

Antidepressants in every class (SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) have been shown to reduce bulimic symptoms and can be used safely to treat depression, with the exception of bupropion. Bupropion use has been associated with an increased risk of seizures in patients with bulimia and an FDA warning limits its use.
