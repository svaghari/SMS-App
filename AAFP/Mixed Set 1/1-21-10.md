SGLT2 inhibitors such as empagliflozin (Jardiance)

SGLT2 inhibitors are known to cause an increased risk of yeast vaginitis because their mechanism of action
involves blocking renal uptake of glucose, which results in an increase in glucosuria (SOR A). Common
side effects of metformin include gastrointestinal upset. DPP-4 inhibitors have very few side effects.
GLP-1 receptor agonists typically cause nausea and early satiety and weight loss. Sulfonylureas are
associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia.
