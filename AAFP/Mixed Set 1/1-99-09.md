Spirometry

Based on this patient’s history and physical examination, COPD is the most likely cause of his dyspnea. Initial testing should include spirometry to diagnose airflow obstruction (SOR C). CT, a BNP level, a D-dimer level, and arterial blood gas measurements would not be the best initial tests in the evaluation of this patient’s dyspnea.
