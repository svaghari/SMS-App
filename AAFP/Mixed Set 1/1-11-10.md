130/80 mm Hg

The latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines promote a radical
change in the management of hypertension, which they now define as a blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg.
Elevated blood pressure is defined as a systolic pressure of 120–129 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure <80
mm Hg. A blood pressure of 130–139/80–89 mm Hg is classified as stage 1 hypertension and a systolic
pressure 140 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure 90 mm Hg is classified as stage 2 hypertension.
