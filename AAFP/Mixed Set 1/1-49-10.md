The risk of mortality is increased

Both typical and atypical antipsychotics increase the risk of mortality in patients with dementia. The FDA has a black box warning on these medications, including risperidone, about the increased risk of mortality in patients with dementia. Risperidone is not approved by the FDA for dementia-related psychosis. The typical antipsychotics are more commonly associated with extrapyramidal side effects. Diabetes mellitus and agranulocytosis are associated with the atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone. Periodic monitoring of serum glucose levels and CBCs is recommended.
