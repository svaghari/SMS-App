Levofloxacin

The FDA issued a warning that systemic fluoroquinolones can increase the occurrence of aortic dissections
or ruptures. Drugs in this group should be avoided in patients with an existing aortic aneurysm or in
patients at increased risk for developing an aortic aneurysm unless there are no other treatment options
available. Patients at increased risk include those with peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, Marfan
syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Similarly, the use of systemic fluoroquinolones should be avoided
in the elderly. Aztreonam, ceftriaxone, and doxycycline are not associated with this side effect (SOR A).
