Inconsistent answers to questions

In order for patients to show they have the capacity to make a decision they must demonstrate an
understanding of the situation, including the risks, benefits, and consequences of the decision or refusal
of care. If a patient gives inconsistent answers to questions after multiple explanations, this indicates that
there is a lack of understanding and would meet one of the criteria to determine that the patient lacks the
capacity to make that decision. The presence of dementia can be associated with an increased incidence
of having a lack of capacity; however, a diagnosis of dementia by itself does not indicate that the patient
lacks the capacity to make a decision. While disorientation to time or a lower score on the Mini-Mental
State Examination is associated with an increased risk of lacking capacity, these findings alone would not
be enough to determine that the patient lacks capacity. The patient asking that her son be her medical
decision maker instead of her daughter would not be an indication that she lacks capacity.
