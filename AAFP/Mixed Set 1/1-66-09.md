65%

The ejection fraction value is an important measure of left ventricular function, especially with regard to previous cardiac events, medications, exercise tolerance, and preoperative risk. The normal predicted value is 55%â€“75% when measured by echocardiography in a healthy asymptomatic patient. There is no gender difference, but there is a decline with age. It may be as low as 15% in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Ischemic and valvular heart disease may significantly reduce the ejection fraction.
