No antibiotic prophylaxis

According to the American Heart Associationâ€™s 2007 guidelines, prophylaxis to prevent bacterial
endocarditis associated with dental, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary procedures is now indicated only for
high-risk patients with prosthetic valves, a previous history of endocarditis, unrepaired cyanotic congenital
heart disease (CHD), or CHD repaired with prosthetic material, and for cardiac transplant recipients who
develop valvular disease.

Based on a risk-benefit analysis in light of available evidence for and against antibiotic prophylaxis, these
recommendations specifically exclude mitral valve prolapse and acquired valvular disease, even if they are
associated with mitral regurgitation. The American Dental Association has endorsed this guideline.
