along the medial border of each scapula

The typical fibromyalgia trigger points lie along the medial scapula borders, as well as the posterior neck, upper outer quadrants of the gluteal muscles, and medial fat pads of the knees. Tenderness of the anatomic snuffbox, Achilles tendons, or web spaces of the toes would most likely be related to another diagnosis.
