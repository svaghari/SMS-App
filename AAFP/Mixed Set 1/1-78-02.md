Evaluation for a source of blood loss

Anemia of chronic disease is characterized by the underproduction of red cells, due to low serum iron caused by the uptake of iron by the reticuloendothelial system.  Total-body iron stores are increased but the iron in storage is not available for red cell production.  This anemia is normochromic and normocytic, and is associated with a reduction in iron, transferrin, and transferrin saturation.  Ferritin is either normal or increased, reflecting both the increased iron within the reticuloendothelial system and increases due to immune activation (acute phase reactant).  In iron deficiency anemia, total-body iron levels are low, leading to hypochromia and microcytosis, low iron levels, increased transferrin levels, and reduced ferritin levels.  This patientâ€™s anemia is most likely multifactorial, with anemia of chronic disease and drug effects playing a role.  However, she also has iron deficiency, and searching for a source of blood loss would be important.  With thalassemia, marked microcytosis is seen, and with hemolysis, slight macrocytosis and an increased reticulocyte count would be expected. Ref: Weiss G, Goodnough LT: Anemia of chronic disease.
