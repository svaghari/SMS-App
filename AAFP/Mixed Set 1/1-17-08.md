the percentage of patients with the disease who have a positive test result

Sensitivity is the percentage of patients with a disease who have a positive test result. Specificity is the percentage of patients without the disease who have a negative test result. Pretest probability is the probability of disease before a test is performed. Posttest probability is the probability of disease after a test is performed. Positive predictive value is the percentage of patients with a positive test result who are confirmed to have the disease.
