Ultrasonography

Ultrasonography is recommended as the first imaging modality to evaluate acute abdominal pain in children. It avoids radiation exposure and is useful for detecting many causes of abdominal pain, including appendicitis. After ultrasonography, CT or MRI can be used if necessary to diagnose appendicitis. Abdominal radiography is helpful in patients with constipation, possible bowel obstruction, or a history of previous abdominal surgery.

The American Academy of Pediatrics Choosing Wisely recommendation on the evaluation of abdominal pain states that CT is not always necessary. The American College of Surgeons Choosing Wisely recommendation on the evaluation of suspected appendicitis in children says that CT should be avoided until after ultrasonography has been considered as an option.
