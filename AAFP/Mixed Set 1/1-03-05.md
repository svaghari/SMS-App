Stone cutter

Family physicians should be aware of the environmental exposures associated with pulmonary disease. Stone cutting, sand blasting, mining, and quarrying expose patients to silica, which is an inorganic dust that causes pulmonary fibrosis (silicosis). Occupational exposure to beryllium, which is also an inorganic dust, occurs in the high-tech electronics manufacturing industry and results in chronic beryllium lung disease. Exposure to organic agricultural dusts (fungal spores, vegetable products, insect fragments, animal dander, animal feces, microorganisms, and pollens) can result in “farmer’s lung,” a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Other organic dust exposures, such as exposures to grain dust in bakers, can lead to asthma, chronic bronchitis, and COPD. Firefighters are at risk of smoke inhalation and are exposed to toxic chemicals that can cause many acute and chronic respiratory symptoms.
