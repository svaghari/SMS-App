Inhaled low-dose corticosteroids

This patient has moderate persistent asthma. Although many parents are concerned about corticosteroid use in children with open growth plates, inhaled corticosteroids have not been proven to prematurely close growth plates, and are the most effective treatment with the least side effects. Scheduled use of a shortacting bronchodilator has been shown to cause tachyphylaxis, and is not recommended. The same is true for long-acting bronchodilators. Leukotriene use may be beneficial, but compared to those using inhaled corticosteroids, patients using leukotrienes are 65% more likely to have an exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids.
