eating poppy seed muffins

Eating as little as one poppy seed muffin can produce amounts of morphine and codeine detectable by immunoassay, as well as by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Passively inhaled crack cocaine or marijuana (unless an extreme amount is inhaled), and ingested products containing hemp or other common herbal preparations do not produce positive urine drug screens. In addition to poppy seeds, substances reported to cause false-positive urine drug screens include selegiline, Vicks inhalers, NSAIDs, oxaprozin, fluoroquinolones, rifampin, venlafaxine, and dextromethorphan.
