Aortic insufficiency

This adolescent has findings of Marfan syndrome.  It is associated with arachnodactly, arm span greater than height, a high arched palate, kyphosis, lenticular dislocation, mitral valve prolapse, myopia, and pectus excavatum.  Cardiac examination may reveal an aortic insufficiency murmur, or a murmur associated with mitral valve prolapse.  Cardiovascular defects are progressive, and aortic root dilation occurs in 80%-100% of affected individuals.  Aortic regurgitation becomes more common with increasing age.
