Estimated glomerular filtration rate

Secondary prevention of fractures is an important component of care following a hip fracture. Options to consider include bisphosphonates, calcium supplementation, and vitamin D supplementation. Bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid, can reduce rates of clinical fractures among patients who have had a hip fracture (SOR A). While long-term use of bisphosphonates may increase the risk of jaw osteonecrosis and anemia, a CBC is not necessary before initiating therapy. Contraindications to zoledronic acid include hypocalcemia and a creatinine clearance <35 mL/min or other evidence of acute renal impairment.
