Glimepiride (Amaryl)

Since many patients with diabetes mellitus are obese, the impact of medications on the patientâ€™s weight is important to consider. Treatment with sulfonylureas, including glimepiride, is associated with weight gain. Empagliflozin, liraglutide, metformin, and sitagliptin are not associated with weight gain. In particular, the SGLT2 inhibitors such as empagliflozin and the GLP1 agonists such as liraglutide are associated with clinically significant weight loss.
