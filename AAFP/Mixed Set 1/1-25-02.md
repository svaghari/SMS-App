Naproxen

Once the diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is made, NSAIDs such as aspirin or naproxen should be
administered (SOR B). The therapeutic response to NSAIDs is often remarkable. Acetaminophen has not
been shown to be a superior analgesic for acute rheumatic fever. Gabapentin is not indicated, especially
considering that the pain does not have a neuropathic etiology. Opioids would not be considered first-line
treatment because of their adverse effects and the dramatic response of NSAIDs alone.
