Referral for psychotherapy

This patient has peripartum depression. All women should be screened for depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period (SOR B). Reassurance may be appropriate for the baby blues, which usually start 2â€“3 days after birth and last less than 10 days. First-time mothers, adolescent mothers, and mothers who have experienced a traumatic delivery may benefit from home health visits or peer support to prevent but not treat peripartum depression. Mild to moderate peripartum depression can be treated with psychotherapy or SSRIs, with consideration of medications with the lowest serum medication levels in breastfed infants. Tricyclic antidepressants such as trazodone are not considered first-line treatment for peripartum depression.
