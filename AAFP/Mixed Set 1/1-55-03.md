opiates

When administered at appropriate doses, opiates do not reduce or compromise respiratory status and do not hasten dying. Opiates help to reduce the sense of air hunger in patients with dyspnea. The use of opiates for palliative therapy in advanced pulmonary disease is supported by clinical guidelines from the American Thoracic Society.
