Locking of the joint

Patellofemoral pain syndrome is a clinical diagnosis and is the most common cause of knee pain in the outpatient setting.  It is characterized by anterior knee pain, particularly with activities that overload the joint, such as stair climbing, running, and squatting.  Patients complain of popping, catching, stiffness, and giving way.  On examination there will be a positive J sign, with the patella moving from a medial to a lateral location when the knee is fully extended from the 90Â° position.  This is caused by an imbalance in the medial and lateral forces acting on the patella.  Locking is not characteristic of patellofemoral pain syndrome, so a loose body or  meniscal tear should be considered if this is reported.
