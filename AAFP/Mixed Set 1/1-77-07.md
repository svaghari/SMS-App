Malingering

This patient most likely is malingering, which is to purposefully feign physical symptoms for external gain.  Factitious disorder involves adopting physical symptoms for unconscious internal gain, such as deriving comfort from taking on the role of being sick.  Somatization disorder is related to numerous unexplained physical symptoms that last for several years and typically begin before 30 years of age.  Conversion disorder involves a single voluntary motor or sensory dysfunction suggestive of a neurologic condition, but not conforming to any known anatomic pathways or physiologic mechanisms.
