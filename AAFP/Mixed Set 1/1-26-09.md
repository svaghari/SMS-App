a sling for 2–6 weeks

Fractures of the clavicle are common in young individuals, usually from sports injuries or direct trauma. Eighty percent of these fractures occur in the midclavicle. Unless significantly displaced, these fractures do not require referral. They can be treated with just a sling for 2–6 weeks. A sling is more comfortable and less irritating than a figure-of-eight bandage. Passive range of motion of the shoulder is indicated as soon as the pain allows. Physical therapy may be started at 4 weeks after the injury.
