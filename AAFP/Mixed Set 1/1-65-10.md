A hematoma within the abdominal wall musculature

Carnettâ€™s sign is the easing of the pain of abdominal palpation with tightening of the abdominal muscles. If the cause is visceral, the taut abdominal muscles could guard the source of pain from the examining hand. In contrast, intensification of pain with this maneuver points to a source of pain within the abdominal wall itself.
