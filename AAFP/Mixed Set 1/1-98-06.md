Optimal management of the underlying disorder

There is no specific therapy for anemia of chronic disease except to manage or treat the underlying disorder. Iron therapy is of no benefit, but erythropoietin may be helpful in some patients. There is no available data to suggest that combination therapy or prednisone is beneficial for this disorder.
