rheumatoid arthritis

This patient has rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by symptoms and physical findings.  A positive latex fixation test for rheumatoid factor is not necessary for the diagnosis.  A negative rheumatoid factor does not exclude RA, and a positive rheumatoid factor is not specific. Rheumatoid factor is found in the serum of approximately 85% of adult patients with RA; in subjects without RA, the incidence of positive rheumatoid factor is 1%â€“5% and increases with age.
The ANA test is positive in at least 95% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, but in only about 35% of patients with RA.  Elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is seen in many patients with RA, and the degree of elevation roughly parallels disease activity.  At a mean of 6 months after the onset of Lyme disease, 60% of patients in the United States have brief attacks of asymmetric, oligoarticular arthritis, primarily in the large joints and especially in the knee.
