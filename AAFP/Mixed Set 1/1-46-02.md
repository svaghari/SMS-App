Polyethylene glycol

Hypertonic osmotic laxatives such as milk of magnesia, magnesium citrate, and sodium phosphate draw water into the bowel and should be used with caution in older adults and those with renal impairment because of the risk of electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Lactulose, also an osmotic laxative, should be avoided in patients with IBS because it is broken down by colonic flora and produces excessive gas. Polyethylene glycol, a long-chain polymer of ethylene oxide, is a large molecule that causes water to be retained in the colon, which softens the stool and increases the number of bowel movements. It is approved by the FDA for short-term treatment in adults and children with occasional constipation and is commonly prescribed for patients with IBS. It is considered safe and effective for moderate to severe constipation when used either daily or as needed.
