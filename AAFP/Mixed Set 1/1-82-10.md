Elevated methylmalonic acid

This patient has several clinical features of vitamin B12 deficiency. Some patients with significant vitamin B12 deficiency have levels in the lower range of normal, as this patient does. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor in the synthesis of both methionine and succinyl coenzyme A, and vitamin B12 deficiency leads to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, which are the precursors of these compounds. An elevated level of these substances is therefore more sensitive than a low vitamin B12 level for vitamin B12 deficiency. Homocysteine is also elevated in folic acid deficiency, however, so a methylmalonic acid level is recommended if vitamin B12 deficiency is a concern and serum vitamin B12 levels are 150â€“400 pg/mL. A reduced haptoglobin level is useful to confirm hemolytic anemia. An elevated free erythrocyte protoporphyrin level may occur in lead poisoning or iron deficiency. An elevated angiotensin converting enzyme level is found in sarcoidosis. Ref: Oh R, Brown DL: Vitamin B12 deficiency. Am Fam Physician 2003;67(5):979-986, 993-994.
