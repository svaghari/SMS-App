Prolonged second stage of labor

Multiple systematic reviews have been conducted to examine the effects of epidural anesthesia on maternal and neonatal outcomes. There are many confounding variables in the studies and, as a result, only a few effects of epidural anesthesia are consistently seen on a statistically significant basis: an increased duration of the second stage of labor, an increased rate of instrument-assisted vaginal deliveries, and an increased likelihood of maternal fever. Overall, there is no statistically significant difference in the duration of the first stage of labor, the incidence of low Apgar scores, or the incidence of maternal backache at 3 months or 12 months.
