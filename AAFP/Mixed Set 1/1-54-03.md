Letrozole (Femara)

In a double-blind randomized trial, letrozole was associated with greater live-birth and ovulation rates compared to clomiphene (SOR A). A Cochrane review indicated that metformin does not increase fertility in patients diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Spironolactone and finasteride are both used to treat PCOS in women who do not desire pregnancy.
