iron deficiency anemia

This patient most likely has iron deficiency anemia. The low normal mean corpuscular volume, low serum ferritin, and low reticulocyte index are all consistent with iron deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency would be indicated by low vitamin B12 and a macrocytic anemia. Serum ferritin would be higher with anemia of chronic disease and myelodysplastic anemia. The reticulocyte index would be high with hemolysis.
