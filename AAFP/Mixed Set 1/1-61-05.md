Emergent evaluation by an ophthalmologist

This patient has symptoms and examination findings that are concerning for acute angle-closure glaucoma. Her risk factors include her age, sex, and Asian ancestry. The examination findings include conjunctival redness, corneal edema, a poorly reactive mid-dilated pupil, decreased vision, severe eye pain, headache, and nausea. This condition needs to be evaluated and treated emergently to preserve vision. The examination is not consistent with infectious conjunctivitis, which generally does not cause severe pain, headache, or decreased pupillary response. Conditions such as scleritis or episcleritis may present with similar features, but the pupillary response may help differentiate them from glaucoma. Referral to an ophthalmologist would still be most prudent. This patient’s presentation is not consistent with a vasculitis or multiple sclerosis.
