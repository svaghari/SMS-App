increased hospitalizations for patients with chronic illnesses

Increasing prescription copayments results in a decrease in the number of prescriptions filled and worsening clinical outcomes for patients with heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and schizophrenia. With each 10% increase in copayments, it is estimated that overall prescription spending decreases 2%â€“6%. The cited study found that up to 25% of Medicaid recipients, faced with a copayment, could not afford to fill at least one prescription in the previous year.
