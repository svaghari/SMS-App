Arthrocentesis

This patient has a history and physical examination concerning for septic arthritis, which is a rheumatologic emergency due to the potential for joint destruction. Joint swelling, redness, and warmth may accompany the pain but these are more difficult to detect at the hip than the knee. Systemic symptoms such as fever may occur but are absent in more than 40% of patients, particularly elderly patients and those who are immunocompromised. Risk factors for septic arthritis include underlying joint disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, and immunosuppressive states such as HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, and taking immunosuppressive medications. This patient has a history of osteoarthritis and is taking adalimumab, an immunosuppressive agent. Although there may be clues to the diagnosis of septic arthritis on imaging and laboratory assessment, the diagnostic test of choice is analysis of synovial fluid obtained through arthrocentesis. A radionuclide bone scan, CT, MR arthrography, and MRI are not sensitive enough to rule out septic arthritis.
