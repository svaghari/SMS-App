Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)

Prophylactic antibiotics should be given for all closed-fist injuries unless the skin has not been penetrated,
and for puncture wounds caused by cat bites. The antibiotic should have both aerobic and anaerobic
activity and include Pasteurella coverage for animal bites and Eikenella coverage for human bites.
Suggested regimens include amoxicillin/clavulanate. If the patient is allergic to penicillin, clindamycin plus
levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, which has anaerobic coverage, can be used. Azithromycin, cephalexin, and
metronidazole are not first-line antibiotics following a cat bite.
