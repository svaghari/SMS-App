Intranasal budesonide (Rhinocort)

This patient has symptoms consistent with allergic rhinitis, and the presence of symptoms more than 4 days per week and for more than 4 weeks places her into the persistent symptoms category. In addition to allergen avoidance and patient education, an intranasal corticosteroid should be the first-line treatment for allergic rhinitis with persistent symptoms (SOR A).

The Choosing Wisely recommendations from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundations include avoiding sinonasal imaging in patients with symptoms limited to a primary diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. Impermeable pillow or mattress covers are often recommended but there is no evidence of any benefit (SOR A). Intranasal saline irrigation is beneficial and can be used as monotherapy for mild intermittent symptoms, but intranasal corticosteroids are likely to provide more benefit for more persistent symptoms. Intranasal antihistamines such as azelastine are more expensive, less effective, and more likely to produce adverse effects than intranasal corticosteroids, so they are not recommended as first-line therapy (SOR B).
