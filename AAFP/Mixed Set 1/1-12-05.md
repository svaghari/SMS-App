Alendronate (Fosamax)

Patients are at risk of developing glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis if they are on long-term
glucocorticoid therapy, defined as >2.5 mg of prednisone for a duration of 3 months or longer. The
American College of Rheumatology recommends pharmacologic treatment for these patients, as well as
for patients receiving glucocorticoids who have a bone mineral density T-score –2.5 at either the spine
or the femoral neck and are either male and 50 years of age or female and postmenopausal. Therapy is
also recommended in patients 40 years of age who do not meet these criteria but have a 10-year risk of
major osteoporotic fracture of at least 20% or a risk of hip fracture of at least 3% according to the FRAX
tool.
Oral bisphosphonates are recommended as first-line agents for preventing glucocorticoid-induced
osteoporotic fractures, although intravenous bisphosphonates can be used if patients are unable to use the
oral forms. Supplementation of calcium (800–1000 mg) and vitamin D (400–800 IU) is also recommended.
Raloxifene and teriparatide are options when bisphosphonate therapy fails or is contraindicated (SOR A).
