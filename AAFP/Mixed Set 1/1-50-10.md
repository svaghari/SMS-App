Serum protein electrophoresis

This patientâ€™s presentation is concerning for hematologic malignancy, in particular multiple myeloma. Along with radiography, the next appropriate step is serum protein electrophoresis. If laboratory work shows a monoclonal spike or if a skeletal survey indicates lytic lesions, referral to an oncologist is indicated for a bone marrow biopsy. MRI of the lumbar spine would be premature and obtaining iron studies, a TSH level, or a vitamin B12 level would not adequately address the initial abnormal laboratory studies or facilitate making the diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
