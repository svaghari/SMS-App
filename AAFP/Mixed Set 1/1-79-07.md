Radioactive iodine

The ophthalmopathy of Graveâ€™s disease may initially flare and worsen when treated with radioactive iodine.  Antithyroid drugs, including propylthiouracil, and methimazole, are not associated with this problem.  The addition of thyroid hormone to these drugs at suppressive doses has not shown any clear benefit over titration of the antithyroid drug, and relapse rates are similar.  Thyroid surgery in the controlled patient has not been significantly associated with this problem. Ref: Larsen PR, Kronenberg HM, Malmed S, et al (eds): Williams Textbook of Endocrinology, ed 10.
