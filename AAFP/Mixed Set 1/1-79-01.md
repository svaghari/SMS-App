Chlordiazepoxide (Librium)

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome encompasses a wide range of symptoms involving primarily the central nervous, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems, and is mediated by the abrupt removal of alcohol-enhanced GABA inhibition of excitatory glutamate receptors in the central nervous system.  It generally is divided into three stages, based on severity and timeline; seizures may occur during any of these stages and may be the first sign of withdrawal. The ideal pharmacologic agent should provide not only safe sedation but also protection from seizures.  Long-acting benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide have been shown to be superior to the other choices in numerous studies.  Clonidine and atenolol have been found to be useful in symptom reduction but not in seizure prevention.  Phenytoin would seem to offer protection from seizures, but studies have not consistently shown this to be the case.  Phenobarbital, while effective, has a very narrow therapeutic window, making its use problematic. Ref: Blondell RD: Ambulatory detoxification of patients with alcohol dependence.
