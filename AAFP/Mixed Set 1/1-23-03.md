Hyponatremia

Elderly patients, especially those taking hydrochlorothiazide, are at risk for developing hyponatremia while taking carbamazepine. Carbamazepine is one of the medications that can cause the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, as it interferes with the ability to dilute the urine. It does not lead to the other derangements listed (SOR A).
