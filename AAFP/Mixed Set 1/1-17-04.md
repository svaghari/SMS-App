lower than in the nonpregnant state

The TSH reference range is lower during pregnancy because of the cross-reactivity of the -subunit of
hCG. Levels of hCG peak during weeks 7â€“13 of pregnancy, and hCG has mild TSH-like activity, leading
to slightly high free T4 levels in early pregnancy. This leads to a feedback decrease in TSH.
