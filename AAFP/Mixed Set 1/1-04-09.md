Slipped capital femoral epiphysis

The most common hip disorder in adolescents (ages 8–15) is slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Early diagnosis and treatment are critical in preventing disability related to early-onset degenerative disease of the hip. In the past, SCFE has been more common in boys than in girls but that prevalence is changing due to the rise in obesity. SCFE should be suspected in an adolescent who has unexplained pain in the hip, groin, thigh, or knee. It is rarely associated with trauma, overuse, or prior illness. On examination the most indicative sign is limited internal rotation of the involved hip. Bilateral radiographs of the hips, including frog-leg lateral views, should be obtained in any adolescent who presents with a new limp and pain in the groin, hip, thigh, or knee (SOR C).

Adductor muscle strain (groin strain) is very uncommon in adolescents. Patients suspected of having a groin strain should also undergo radiography. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease and transient synovitis are more common in children under age 10. The presenting symptoms of hip pain and a limp are similar to SCFE. Apophysitis of the anterior superior iliac spine is common in adolescents but is caused by overuse. It is mostly seen in runners, dancers, and ice hockey and soccer players ages 14–18.
