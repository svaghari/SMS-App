Washing clothing and bedding in hot water and drying with hot air

The appropriate recommendation for head lice is to wash any recently used bedding and clothing with hot
water or expose them for 5 minutes to a temperature >130Â°F to kill lice and eggs. Items that cannot be
washed or dried in this manner or dry-cleaned should be sealed in a plastic bag for 2 weeks. Additional
or alternative treatments include topical ivermectin, benzoyl alcohol, malathion, and spinosad. Other
recommended measures include removal of any visible nits (eggs) with a nit comb, not a brush. Topical
petroleum jelly is not an effective treatment. Conditioners can interfere with the action of permethrin,
decreasing its effectiveness. Human head lice are specific to humans, so pets are not affected.
