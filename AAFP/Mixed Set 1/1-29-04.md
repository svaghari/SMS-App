Repeat blood cultures 2–4 days after the initial set and as needed thereafter

This patient’s MRSA bacteremia is considered uncomplicated due to the effectiveness of the antibiotic therapy and the lack of endocarditis or implanted prostheses such as heart valves. Therefore, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that follow-up cultures of blood samples be obtained 2–4 days after the initial cultures and as needed thereafter to document clearance of bacteremia (SOR A; Quality of Evidence II).
