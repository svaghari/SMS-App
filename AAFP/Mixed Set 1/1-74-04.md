Norepinephrine (Levophed)

In a patient with sepsis, vasopressors are indicated when fluid resuscitation does not restore organ perfusion and blood pressure.  Norepinephrine and dopamine currently are the preferred pressor agents; however, norepinephrine appears to be more effective and has a lower mortality rate.  Phenylephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin should not be used as first-line therapy.  Vasopressin is employed after high-dose conventional vasopressors have failed.  The use of low-dose dopamine is no longer recommended based on a clinical trial showing no benefit in critically ill patients at risk for renal failure.  If an agent is needed to increase cardiac output, dobutamine is the agent of choice.
