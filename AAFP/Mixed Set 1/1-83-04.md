Abdominal/pelvic CT

Seventy to ninety percent of patients with acute appendicitis have leukocytosis, but this is also a characteristic of other conditions, and thus has poor specificity for acute appendicitis. The urinalysis may exhibit microscopic pyuria or hematuria in a patient with acute appendicitis, but these findings may also be present with urinary tract disease. Plain radiographs of the abdomen are of limited value in diagnosing acute appendicitis. Ultrasonography can be useful, especially in ruling out gynecologic problems, but is technician-dependent and is not as specific nor sensitive as CT scanning, which has a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy in excess of 90%. In cases where the CT scan is indeterminate, patients should be admitted to the hospital for close observation with repeated physical examinations to monitor clinical status.
