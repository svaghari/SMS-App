Increasing the dosage of the corticosteroid

This patient has severe asthma that is not responding to a moderate dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, a leukotriene inhibitor, and a long-acting Î²-agonist. The next appropriate step is to add a stronger dose of inhaled corticosteroid. Methotrexate and azithromycin are considered inappropriate therapies. Theophylline and low-dose oral prednisone are considered appropriate steps if the patient does not respond to high doses of an inhaled corticosteroid. Other reasonable options for the treatment of severe asthma would be a muscarinic antagonist such as tiotropium, or assessing for the presence of IgE-dependent allergic asthma that may respond to omalizumab.
