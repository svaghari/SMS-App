Renal function studies

The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) has recently revised its physical status classification system. A healthy patient would be classified as ASA I, while a patient with mild systemic disease would be classified as ASA II. All patients who are having major surgery should be offered preoperative laboratory testing, including a CBC and renal function testing. For patients who are ASA III or IV and have chronic liver disease or take anticoagulants, coagulation testing should be considered. There is no compelling evidence to support either a chest radiograph or an EKG as part of a routine preoperative evaluation.
