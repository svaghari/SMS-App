No imaging

Uncomplicated acute low back pain and/or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition and early
imaging is associated with worse overall outcomes and is likely to identify minor abnormalities even in
asymptomatic patients. Imaging for acute low back pain should be reserved for cases that are suspicious
for cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. In the absence of red flags such as
progressive motor or sensory loss, new urinary retention or overflow incontinence, a history of cancer,
a recent invasive spinal procedure, or significant trauma relative to age, imaging is not warranted
regardless of whether radiculopathy is present, unless symptoms persist despite a trial of at least 6 weeks
of medical management and physical therapy.
