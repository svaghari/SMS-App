ACTH

A plasma ACTH level is recommended to establish primary adrenal insufficiency. The sample can be obtained at the same time as the baseline sample in the corticotropin test. A plasma ACTH greater than twice the upper limit of the reference range is consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency. Aldosterone and renin levels should be obtained to establish the presence of adrenocortical insufficiency, but these do not differentiate primary from secondary adrenal insufficiency. The hyperpigmentation of Addison’s disease is caused by the melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)–like effect of the elevated plasma levels of ACTH. ACTH shares some amino acids with MSH and also produces an increase in MSH in the blood. TSH is not part of the feedback loop of adrenal insufficiency.
