The inability to take more than two steps

Several decision support tools can help guide the decision to order imaging of an injured knee, such as the
Ottawa Knee Rule, the Pittsburgh Knee Rule, and American College of Radiology (ACR) criteria. The
inability to take four or more steps immediately after an injury or in the emergency setting is an indication
for radiography in all three rules.
Age is an indication for radiography in acute knee pain in patients over 55 years of age according to the
Ottawa rule, or under 12 or over 50 years of age according to the Pittsburgh rule. The patient’s sex does
not factor into the criteria for imaging.
Bony tenderness is an indication for imaging according to the ACR and Ottawa rules, but only if isolated
over the proximal fibula or over the patella without other bony tenderness. The inability to flex the knee
to 90° is also an indication for imaging according to the ACR and Ottawa rules.
