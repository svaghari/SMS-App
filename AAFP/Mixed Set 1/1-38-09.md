No treatment at this time and a repeat TSH level in 3 months

This patient has subclinical hypothyroidism and should have a TSH level repeated in 1–3 months, as TSH may fluctuate in patients without thyroid disease and return to normal on subsequent testing. In a patient with a normal free T4 the TSH level must be >10 μU/mL for a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Mild TSH elevations may be a normal manifestation of aging.
