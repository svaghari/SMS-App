Curvature of the fifth digit of the hand (clinodactyly)

In addition to clinodactyly, fetal alcohol syndrome is associated with camptodactyly (flexion deformity of the fingers), other flexion contractures, radioulnar synostosis, scoliosis, and spinal malformations. It is also associated with many neurologic, behavioral, and cardiovascular abnormalities, as well as other types of abnormalities. Plagiocephaly, supernumerary digits, syndactyly, and metatarsus adductus are common in newborns but are not related to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
