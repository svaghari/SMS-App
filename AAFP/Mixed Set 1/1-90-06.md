Polycystic ovary syndrome

Recent data suggest that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are important in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (POS). Treatment with drugs that reduce insulin levels, such as metformin, has been shown to correct many of the metabolic abnormalities associated with POS. Such correction results in resumption of ovulation, decreased insulin resistance, and improved beta-cell function; it also produces improvement in cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia and impaired fibrinolysis.
