An oral osmotic agent such as polyethylene glycol 3350 (MiraLax)

Oral osmotics such as polyethylene glycolâ€“based solutions are recommended as an appropriate initial
approach to constipation in children because they are effective, easy to administer, noninvasive, and well
tolerated (SOR C). Rectal therapies are similar in terms of effectiveness but are more invasive and less
commonly used as first-line treatment (SOR A). Oral stimulants and bisacodyl rectal suppositories are not
recommended for children under 2 years of age. Enemas are sometimes used as second-line therapy, but
the addition of enemas to oral laxative regimens does not improve outcomes in children with severe
constipation (SOR B). Manual disimpaction is a more invasive option and is not recommended as first-line
treatment in young children.
