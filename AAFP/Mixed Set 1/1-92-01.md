Heparin

A number of medications can cause thrombocytopenia, but heparin is a more likely cause than enalapril, furosemide, labetalol, or insulin. Even the small doses of heparin used to flush intravenous lines can be a source of thrombocytopenia. Ref: Drug Facts and Comparisons, 2004 Edition. Facts and Comparisons, 2004, pp 188-189.
