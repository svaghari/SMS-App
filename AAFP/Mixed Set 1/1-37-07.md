Daily folic acid supplementation

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that all women planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily folic acid supplement containing 0.4–0.8 mg (400–800 μg) (A recommendation). A manual breast examination by the clinician or patient is not recommended by the USPSTF. Cervical cytology (a Papanicolaou test) is recommended every 5 years if results are normal and it is combined with negative high-risk HPV testing (A recommendation). Chlamydia screening is recommended yearly for all sexually active females under age 25 and older individuals at higher risk. For women who are over 25 and not at increased risk the USPSTF makes no recommendation for or against screening (C recommendation). This patient was screened for lipid disorders 3 years ago. While the best screening interval for lipids is not clearly defined, there is no clear recommendation to repeat screening lipids at this time. The USPSTF makes no recommendation for or against screening for lipid disorders in women who are not at increased risk for coronary heart disease (C recommendation).
