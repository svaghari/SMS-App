Discharge with a catheter in place and close follow-up

This patient suffers from postpartum urinary retention (PUR). PUR is often defined as a post-void bladder residual of at least 150 cc that is present 6 hours or more after delivery. This condition is more likely to occur in patients who are primiparous, have a prolonged first or second stage of labor, have instrumented vaginal deliveries, or require a cesarean section for failure to progress. The question of whether epidural anesthesia promotes the condition is still debated. Most cases of PUR will resolve 2–6 days after delivery, but some can take up to several weeks. The use of intermittent self-catheterization or a transurethral catheter is recommended until the patient’s ability to spontaneously micturate returns. Imaging studies and referrals to a specialist are rarely necessary, and no medication has been proven helpful.
