Admit to the hospital for supportive care only

This patient has classic signs and symptoms of viral bronchiolitis, likely due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A chest radiograph is not indicated in a patient with a classic presentation and no focal findings on examination. Most concerning is his history of low urine output, suggesting inadequate oral intake. This is often related to a high respiratory rate and copious nasal secretions. The patient requires hospitalization for monitoring of his respiratory status and supportive care, including intravenous or nasogastric rehydration. At this time the infant does not require supplemental oxygen, as his oxygen saturation is above 90%. Many medications have been studied for the treatment of bronchiolitis in children and most have been found to not provide benefit with regard to the need for hospitalization, length of hospitalization, or disease resolution. Medications that are NOT recommended include inhaled bronchodilators, inhaled epinephrine, inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics.
