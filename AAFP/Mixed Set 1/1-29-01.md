An α1-blocker such as tamsulosin (Flomax)

α1-Blockers such as doxazosin, prazosin, and tamsulosin have been shown to hasten the passage of ureteral stones (level 2 evidence). They are probably more effective than calcium channel blockers (level 2 evidence). β-Blockers, phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil, 5-α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride, and thiazide diuretics have not been shown to hasten stone passage. However, thiazide diuretics have been shown to decrease stone formation in patients with hypercalciuria.
