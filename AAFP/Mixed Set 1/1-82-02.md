Dexamethasone (Decadron), 0.6 mg/kg in a single oral dose

Croup is a viral illness and is not treated with antibiotics. Racemic epinephrine may be used acutely, but rebound can occur. Albuterol has not been shown to be helpful. Oral or intramuscular dexamethasone, 0.6 mg/kg as a single dose, and nebulized budesonide have been shown to reduce croup scores and shorten hospital stays. Ref: Knutson D, Aring A: Viral croup.
