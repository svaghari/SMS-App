Subscapularis

This patientâ€™s pain and weakness while pushing against resistance reveals weakness on internal rotation of the shoulder, which suggests a possible tear of the subscapularis tendon. The inability to keep her hand away from her body when it is placed behind her back describes a positive internal lag test, also suggesting involvement of the subscapularis tendon. The infraspinatus and teres minor are involved in external rotation rather than internal rotation. The supraspinatus and deltoid are involved in abduction of the shoulder.
