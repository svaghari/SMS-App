As many as 20% of newborns will be affected by neonatal acne, usually in the form of pustules confined to the cheeks, chin, eyelids, and forehead. This is typically mild, self-limited, and best managed by reassuring the parents. Acne can also appear in infants, typically males 6â€“12 months of age, and is also usually self-limited and not associated with underlying endocrine pathology in the absence of any other findings suggesting hormonal abnormalities such as clitoromegaly, breast or testicular development, pubic hair growth, hirsutism, or a growth abnormality consistent with increased muscle development. Acne appearing during mid-childhood is rare and, if present, warrants referral for extensive laboratory testing to identify an underlying endocrine abnormality. Preadolescents and adolescents are very likely to develop acne as a result of normal ovarian/testicular development. In the absence of other findings to suggest an endocrine problem, developing an effective treatment regimen is most appropriate for these individuals.
