Subacute thyroiditis

The initial “destructive” phase of subacute thyroiditis presents with signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of overt hyperthyroidism; however, a radioactive iodine uptake scan is negative in this phase. Graves disease and toxic multinodular goiter also present with overt hyperthyroidism, but radioactive iodine uptake is high. Factitious thyrotoxicosis is associated with low TSH and elevated or normal free T4 and total T3, but a goiter is not present. A TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma results in elevated TSH, free T4, and total T3.
