Lorazepam (Ativan) intravenously

Treatment of cocaine-associated chest pain is similar to that of acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina, or acute myocardial infarction, but there are exceptions. The hypertension, tachycardia, and chest pain will often respond to intravenous benzodiazepines as early management. While Î²-blockers are recommended for acute myocardial infarction, they can exacerbate coronary artery spasm in cocaineassociated chest pain. Fibrinolytic therapy should be given only to patients who clearly have an STsegment elevation myocardial infarction and cannot receive immediate direct percutaneous coronary intervention. Calcium channel blocker use in the setting of cocaine-induced ischemia has not been studied, but may be considered if there is no response to benzodiazepines and nitroglycerin. There are no recommendations regarding the use of ACE inhibitors, but these agents would not address the tachycardia.
