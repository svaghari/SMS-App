Valacyclovir and a tapering dose of prednisone

Early recognition and effective treatment of acute Bell’s palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) has been shown to decrease the risk of chronic partial paralysis and pain. Corticosteroids have been shown in a meta-analysis to decrease chronic symptoms, but a Cochrane meta-analysis of 10 studies concluded that antiviral medication along with corticosteroids is significantly more effective than corticosteroids alone. The medications are most effective if started within 72 hours of symptom onset. The same analysis showed that antiviral medications alone were less effective than corticosteroids alone. This patient’s presentation is not consistent with stroke or another emergency. Because supranuclear input to the facial nerves comes from both cerebral hemispheres, strokes and other central pathologies affecting the facial nerves typically spare the forehead, which is not the case in this patient.
