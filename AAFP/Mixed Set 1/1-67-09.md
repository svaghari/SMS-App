High-dose corticosteroids

The clinical findings in this patient are consistent with temporal arteritis: age over 50, new-onset headache, abnormalities of the temporal artery, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A temporal artery biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis, but when the findings are this compelling, corticosteroids should be started even before a biopsy, to prevent further vision loss. Temporal arteritis is the most common clinical pattern of giant cell arteritis, which can also involve other branches of the carotid artery.
