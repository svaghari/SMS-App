Chest radiation for Hodgkin’s disease

MRI of the breasts should be reserved for women at very high risk for breast cancer such as those with genetic mutations, a history of breast irradiation, or a very high-risk family history. Women who had chest radiation therapy during childhood or adolescence, generally for Hodgkin’s disease, are at an extremely high risk for breast cancer.
