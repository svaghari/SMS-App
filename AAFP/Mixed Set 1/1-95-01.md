Norovirus

Recent reports of epidemics of gastroenteritis on cruise ships are consistent with Norovirus infections due to waterborne or foodborne spread. In the United States these viruses are responsible for about 90% of all epidemics of nonbacterial gastroenteritis. The noroviruses are common causes of waterborne epidemics of gastroenteritis, and have been shown to be responsible for outbreaks in nursing homes, on cruise ships, at summer camps, and in schools. Symptomatic treatment by itself is usually appropriate.
