Hyperandrogenism

Several professional organizations have published criteria for the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS) using various combinations of hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), ovulatory dysfunction
(typically oligomenorrhea), and the presence of at least one polycystic ovary by imaging criteria.
Hypertension, hypothyroidism, infertility, and obesity are common symptoms in patients with PCOS but
are not diagnostic.
The National Institutes of Health advises that patients must have both hyperandrogenism and
oligomenorrhea to meet the criteria for PCOS. The Endocrine Society recommends diagnosing PCOS
based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, which require the presence of two of the following:
hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and at least one polycystic ovary. The Androgen Excess and
PCOS Society says that patients must have hyperandrogenism plus either oligomenorrhea or at least one
polycystic ovary for the diagnosis to be made.
