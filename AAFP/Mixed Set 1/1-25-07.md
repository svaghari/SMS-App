Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX)

Childhood constipation is a very common problem encountered in outpatient practice. Most
childhood constipation is functional, which appears to be the case with this patient. She has
no evidence of organic disease, and she had a change in lifestyle that caused her to retain
stool, resulting in a cycle of constipation. Polyethylene glycol is easily tolerated, safe, and
easy to use. For this reason, it is the first-line therapy. A daily dose should resolve this
issue, although it is likely that the child will need another course of treatment, as functional
constipation is likely to recur. It is not reasonable in this case to provide no treatment, as
the child is uncomfortable. An enema would be unnecessary since oral therapies are very
likely to be effective. Behavioral therapies have not been shown to be as effective as
laxatives for functional constipation, and stringent therapy that is not related to food intake
is likely to increase the stress surrounding going to the toilet. There is no role for imaging
in a case where the suspicion of an organic cause is so low.
