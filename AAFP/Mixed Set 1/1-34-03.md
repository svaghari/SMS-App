Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril)

Medications shown to improve mortality in patients with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and in African-American patients, direct-acting vasodilators. Among the β-blockers, carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate have this indication. Diuretics, along with digoxin, may improve symptoms but do not alter disease mortality.
