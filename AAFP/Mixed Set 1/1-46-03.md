MRI of the elbow

Distal biceps tendon ruptures are relatively uncommon, accounting for about 3% of tendon ruptures. In a patient with a suspected distal biceps tendon rupture, clinical signs can be unreliable and MRI imaging is the test of choice. Bony abnormalities do not contribute to the evaluation of this tendon. A Speedâ€™s test is used to evaluate pain related to the long head of the biceps tendon. Surgical repair is the treatment of choice when the tendon is ruptured. Physical therapy and local corticosteroid injections are not beneficial.
