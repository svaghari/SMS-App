Major depressive disorder

Due to the disease prevalence and impact, effectiveness of screening instruments, and benefits of available treatment, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for major depressive disorder when adequate systems are in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up. The USPSTF has made no recommendations regarding screening for bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or schizophrenia.
