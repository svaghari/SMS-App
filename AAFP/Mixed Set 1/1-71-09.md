Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)

Nearly 75% of pregnant women are affected by nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Though dietary
modifications are often recommended, there is little evidence to support their use. Vitamin B6 is
recommended as first-line therapy. It is safe to use in the first trimester and is associated with less
drowsiness compared with other medications.

Scopolamine is effective for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy but should be avoided in the first trimester
due to the possibility of causing trunk and limb deformities. Likewise, methylprednisolone is also effective
but should be avoided in the first trimester as it is associated with an increased risk of cleft palate if used
before 10 weeks of gestation. Auricular acupressure has been found to be ineffective.
