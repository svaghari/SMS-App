A repeat CBC with differential and a review of the peripheral smear

Leukocytosis is a relatively common finding with many possible etiologies. For most cases without a clear cause, a repeat CBC with differential and a peripheral smear review are indicated to confirm leukocytosis, determine subtypes, and look for concerning abnormalities on the smear. Given this patient’s fatigue, a hematologic referral may be indicated if leukocytosis is confirmed on repeat testing. Similar recommendations would apply to flow cytometry testing. Blood cultures are not necessary in cases of leukocytosis without evidence of infection. Obesity can cause leukocytosis, but because of the patient’s fatigue it would not be appropriate at this time to attribute the leukocytosis to obesity alone.
