Bronchiectasis

Bronchiectasis is an illness of the bronchi and bronchioles involving obstructive and infectious processes that injure airways and cause luminal dilation. In addition to daily viscid, often purulent sputum production with occasional hemoptysis, wheezing and dyspnea occur in 75% of patients. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis, forms of COPD, also cause a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio, but the sputum is generally mucoid and luminal dilation of bronchi is not characteristically present. Bronchiolitis is usually secondary to respiratory syncytial virus infection in young children. Asthma is not characterized by the sputum and CT findings seen in this patient.
