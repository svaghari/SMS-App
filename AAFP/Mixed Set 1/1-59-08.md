Posterior urethral valves

Amniotic fluid volume is regulated in part by fetal swallowing, inspiration, and urination. Some malformations of the urinary tract, including renal agenesis and persistent obstruction from posterior urethral valves, lead to oliguria or anuria, and are associated with marked oligohydramnios.

Anencephaly, esophageal atresia, heart failure, and maternal α-thalassemia are associated with polyhydramnios. Anencephaly is probably the most common cause of polyhydramnios, via transudation from the exposed meninges; swallowing difficulties and excessive urination may also be contributing factors. Esophageal atresia is almost always associated with polyhydramnios due to an inability to swallow. Intrauterine heart failure, whether due to dysrhythmias, structural defects, or severe anemia, often leads to fetal hydrops, which is associated with polyhydramnios. α-Thalassemia, relatively common in Asians, can also cause fetal hydrops and polyhydramnios.
