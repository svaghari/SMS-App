Smoking cessation to prevent further vision loss

This patient presents with signs and symptoms that suggest age-related macular degeneration. Smoking is a modifiable risk factor and smokers should be counseled to quit (SOR C). The patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management. Watchful waiting would not be appropriate. Vitamin supplements with Age-Related Eye Disease (AREDS) and AREDS2 formulations have been shown to delay visual loss in patients with age-related macular degeneration (SOR A). Age-related macular degeneration is not reversible but treatment can delay progression or stabilize the changes (SOR A).
