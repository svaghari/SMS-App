Leginella species

Legionella should be considered as a pathogen for community-acquired pneumonia when the patient has a history of a hotel stay or cruise ship travel within the past couple of weeks. Travel to or residence in Southeast Asia or East Asia is a risk factor for avian influenza, exposure to farm animals or parturient cats is a risk factor for Coxiella burnetii infection, exposure to bird or bat droppings is a risk factor for Histoplasma capsulatum infection, and travel to or residence in desert Southwest states with deer mouse exposure is a risk factor for Hantavirus infection.
