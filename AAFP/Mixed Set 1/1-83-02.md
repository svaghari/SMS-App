Panic attack

Panic attacks generally begin between the ages of 17 and 30, and 80% of those affected are women. Panic attacks are manifested by the sudden onset of intense apprehension, fear, or terror, often associated with thoughts of impending doom and at least four of the following somatic symptoms: dyspnea (patients often hyperventilate); palpitations, chest pain, or discomfort; choking or smothering sensations; dizziness; a feeling of unreality; paresthesias; diaphoresis; faintness; trembling or shaking; hot and cold flashes; and fears of dying, going crazy, or losing control during an attack. Hypochondriasis is a condition where the patient is preoccupied with health and absorbed in his/her own physical ailments. Major depressive episodes/depression are characterized by marked, sustained changes of mood. In major depression the prevailing mood is low, being described as “blue,” “down in the dumps,” or apathetic. Part of the low mood consists of a decreased ability to enjoy activities that usually are a source of pleasure. Ref: Rakel RE: Textbook of Family Practice, ed 6.
