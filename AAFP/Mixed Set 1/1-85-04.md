Autonomic neuropathy

Dribbling and increased post-void residual volume (>100 mL) are signs of overflow incontinence. Overflow incontinence can be caused by outflow obstruction (e.g., prostate hypertrophy, urethral constriction, fecal impaction) or, as in this case, by detrusor muscle denervation caused by diabetic or other neuropathies. Excess urine output from hyperglycemia would result in frequent urination, but not urinary retention. Atrophic vaginitis and cystoceles are usually associated with stress incontinence. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is unlikely because the patient does not have any evidence of infection. Ref: Pilot F, Standridge JB, Swagerty D Jr: Caring for the Elderly: A Case-based Approach.
