Protein

Nephrotic syndrome includes peripheral edema, heavy proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia. Hyperlipidemia also occurs frequently and can be significant. Nephrotic-range proteinuria is a spot urine showing a protein/creatinine ratio >3.0–3.5 mg protein/mg creatinine or a 24-hour urine collection showing >3.0–3.5 g of protein. Testing urine for ketones, pH, specific gravity, or crystals does not help to diagnose nephrotic syndrome.
