Isoniazid daily for 9 months

Latent tuberculosis infection carries a risk of progression to active disease, especially among patients who are immunosuppressed. Isoniazid monotherapy is the treatment of choice for most patients with latent tuberculosis infection. Rifampin is not recommended as monotherapy in patients with HIV infection because of increased rates of resistance and drug interactions with many antiretrovirals. Rifampin plus pyrazinamide is no longer recommended for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection because cases of significant hepatotoxicity have occurred with preventive therapy. Combination drug therapy is reserved for treatment of active tuberculosis in order to prevent drug resistance.
