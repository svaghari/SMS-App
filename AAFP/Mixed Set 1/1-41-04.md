Rest, ice, and compression

Prepatellar bursitis is a common superficial bursitis caused by microtrauma from repeated kneeling and crawling. Other terms for this include housemaid’s knee, coal miner’s knee, and carpet layer’s knee. It is usually associated with minimal to no pain. This differs from inflammatory processes such as acute gouty superficial bursitis, which presents as an acutely swollen, red, inflamed bursa and, in rare cases, progresses to chronic tophaceous gout with minimal or no pain.

The proper management of prepatellar bursitis is conservative and includes ice, compression wraps, padding, elevation, analgesics, and modification of activity. There is little evidence that a corticosteroid injection is beneficial, even though it is often done. If inflammatory bursitis is suspected, a corticosteroid injection may be helpful. Fluid aspiration is indicated if septic bursitis is suspected. Surgery can be considered for significant enlargement of a bursa if it interferes with function.
