Respiratory syncytial virus

The most common cause of pneumonia in children age 4 months to 4 years is respiratory syncytial virus. Other viruses may cause pneumonia as well. The peak incidence of respiratory syncytial virus is between 2 and 7 months of age. Wheezing and profuse rhinorrhea are characteristic and the disease typically occurs in mid-winter or early spring epidemics. Parainfluenza 3 typically affects older infants and is not common in winter. Mycoplasma tends to affect older children and children with bacterial illnesses; those infected with this organism generally appear more acutely ill.
