Drug-related events

It has been observed that drug-related problems are the most common type of adverse event, and for hospitalized patients the rate of these events increases with the patientâ€™s age. One study showed that in patients who are >65 years of age, the number of events per 1000 discharges was 11.46 for drug-related events, 6.15 for wound infection, 3.85 for procedure-related events, 3.19 for falls, and 0.09 for anesthesia-related events.
