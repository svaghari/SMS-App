Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder)

After a shoulder dislocation, normal activity can resume when motion and strength in both arms is equal. Immobilization of the shoulder after a dislocation is recommended for at least 1 week. Recurrent shoulder dislocations are more common in younger patients and should be immobilized for 3 weeks in patients under 30 years of age. In patients over 30 years of age, 1 week of immobilization will limit the amount of joint stiffness. Prolonged immobilization is a risk factor for developing adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder). Gentle range-of-motion exercises should be performed during the immobilization period to limit the risk of adhesive capsulitis. Recurrent dislocations, rotator cuff injuries, shoulder impingement syndrome, and acromioclavicular joint injuries are not reduced by gentle range-of-motion exercises.
