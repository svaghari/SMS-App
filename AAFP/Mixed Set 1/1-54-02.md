Discontinue oxygen supplementation

Hypoxemia following an acute illness is often short-lived and as many as half the patients prescribed home oxygen on discharge from the hospital will not meet criteria supporting continuation after 3 months. For this group of patients there is no apparent benefit derived from supplemental oxygen once their oxygen saturation is 88% or greater on room air. Potential harmful effects of continuing unnecessary home oxygen include decreased mobility, falls, house fires, and mucosal irritation, and oxygen toxicity must be considered as well. Continuing home oxygen beyond what is needed also results in a misallocation of resources. According to the American Thoracic Society and the American College of Chest Physicians, prescriptions for supplemental home oxygen should not be renewed for patients who have recently been hospitalized for acute illnesses without assessing them for ongoing hypoxemia.
