A baseline serum cortisol level

In patients with fatigue, family physicians should complete an appropriate history and physical examination. Laboratory studies should be considered, although the results affect management in only 5% of patients. A baseline cortisol level would be valuable only in patients with significant findings of Addison’s disease. In addition to an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a complete metabolic panel, and a TSH level, many physicians request a CBC and a urinalysis. A pregnancy test should be ordered for women of childbearing age. No other tests have been shown to be useful unless a specific medical condition is suspected.
