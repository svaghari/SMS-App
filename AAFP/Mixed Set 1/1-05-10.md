Begin thyroid hormone replacement and repeat the TSH level in 6–8 weeks

This patient has thyroiditis with biochemical evidence for autoimmune (Hashimoto’s) thyroiditis. The most
appropriate plan of care is to begin thyroid hormone replacement and monitor with a repeat TSH level 6–8
weeks later. It is not necessary to include a T3 level when assessing the levothyroxine dose. There is no
need to routinely order thyroid ultrasonography when there are no palpable nodules on a thyroid
examination. Fine-needle aspiration may be necessary to rule out infectious thyroiditis when a patient
presents with severe thyroid pain and systemic symptoms.
