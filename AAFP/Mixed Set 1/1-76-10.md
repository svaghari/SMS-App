is associated with diplopia

Diplopia, along with other neurologic symptoms such as weakness or difficulty with speech, suggests a central cause of vertigo and requires a complete workup.  Dizziness on first arising, dizziness with rolling over in bed, and dizziness with nausea and vomiting are consistent with peripheral causes of vertigo, such as benign positional vertigo.  Dizziness that occurs after a couple of minutes of hyperventilation suggests a psychogenic cause. Ref: Labuguen RH: Initial evaluation of vertigo.
