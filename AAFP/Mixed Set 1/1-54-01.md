A single dose of oral dexamethasone

This patient has symptoms consistent with croup, a lower respiratory infection that is common in the winter months in children ages 6 months to 3 years. The diagnosis is clinical and should be suspected in children with a history of a sudden onset of a deep cough, hoarseness, and a low-grade fever. Randomized studies have shown that even with mild croup (an occasional barking cough with no stridor at rest), oral corticosteroids provide some benefit.

A Cochrane review of two randomized trials with a total of 2024 patients found that chest radiographs did not change the outcome of ambulatory children with lower respiratory tract infections. A patient such as this would not need antiviral treatment for influenza.
