She should receive a third dose of HPV vaccine today

In 2016 the CDC changed the recommendation for the number of HPV vaccine doses for children ages 11–14. Children in this age group need only two doses of HPV vaccine 6–12 months apart. However, if they received two doses of HPV vaccine less than 5 months apart, they still need to have the third dose. Children and young adults over the age of 14 and those with certain immunocompromising conditions still require three doses of HPV vaccine. There is no indication for a booster dose at a later date, nor is there clinical data to support using titers to gauge immunogenicity to HPV.
