Core stability exercise

Low back pain and pelvic pain are commonly encountered in pregnancy, a time when medication or physical modality use may prove undesirable or difficult. A properly prescribed exercise program is a generally safe and effective method to treat this pain. The most appropriate exercises for pregnancyrelated pelvic pain and low back pain target the low back, trunk, and abdominal muscles to increase core stability. Examples of such exercises include Pilates, back extension exercises, and abdominal crunches.Isometric and isotonic exercises work muscle groups against either an external force or opposing muscle groups, and are best suited for the development of muscle tone, strength, and conditioning in the extremities. Likewise, concentric and closed kinetic chain exercises involve working muscles against resistance, and are best suited for rehabilitating and strengthening the extremities.
