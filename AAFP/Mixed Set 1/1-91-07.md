Radiographs of the ankle and foot

The Ottawa Ankle Rules are widely accepted guidelines for appropriate evaluation of ankle and midfoot
injuries occurring in adults age 19 or older presenting for the first time in a clinical setting. The guidelines
utilize the historical and physical findings to determine which radiographic studies, if any, are indicated.
Patients who were able to bear weight immediately following their injury and who can take 4 steps
independently in a clinical setting require radiographic study only when the following criteria are met: pain
is present in the malleolar zone and bony tenderness of the posterior edge or tip of either malleolus is
elicited (ankle radiograph), or pain is present in the midfoot zone and bony tenderness of either the base
of the fifth metatarsal or the navicular region is present.
