Metoclopramide (Reglan)

Diabetic gastroparesis is a delay in the emptying of food from the upper gastrointestinal tract in the absence
of a mechanical obstruction of the stomach or duodenum. Metoclopramide is the only prokinetic agent that
has been studied specifically for long-term use in gastroparesis and is considered first-line therapy (SOR
B). It is among the only FDA-approved medications for gastroparesis. Nortriptyline is a prokinetic agent
but has not been shown to be more effective than placebo for decreasing gastroparesis symptoms. Proton
pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, histamine H2-receptor antagonists such as ranitidine, and ondansetron
delay gastric emptying and should be withheld in patients with gastroparesis whenever possible.
