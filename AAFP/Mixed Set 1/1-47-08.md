An inhaled short-acting β2-agonist 15 minutes before running

This patient’s history and examination findings are typical for exercise-induced asthma. The most appropriate initial treatment for this condition is an inhaled short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) 15 minutes before exercise (SOR A). Daily use of an inhaled long-acting β2-agonist as a single agent is not recommended even for those who continue to experience symptoms when using an inhaled SABA (SOR B). The addition of a daily inhaled corticosteroid is an appropriate consideration for patients who require more than a SABA to control symptoms but these should not be used on an as-needed basis before exercise (SOR B). Use of an antihistamine in an individual with exercise-induced asthma but no known allergies is not recommended (SOR B). Other treatment considerations with weak recommendations include a low-sodium diet, air humidification, and supplemental dietary fish oils.
