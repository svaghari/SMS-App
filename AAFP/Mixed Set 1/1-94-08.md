An increased dosage of levothyroxine

Thyroid hormone requirements increase during pregnancy. Most women with hypothyroidism who become pregnant require an increased levothyroxine dosage (SOR A). A common recommendation is to have women on fixed daily doses of levothyroxine begin taking nine doses weekly (one extra dose on 2 days of the week) as soon as the pregnancy is confirmed (SOR B). Thyroid function tests should be repeated regularly throughout the pregnancy to guide additional dosage adjustments.
