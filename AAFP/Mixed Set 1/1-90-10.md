Upper respiratory symptoms

Echinacea is a genus of native North American plants commonly known as purple coneflower. It has been recommended as a prophylactic treatment for upper respiratory infection, and is widely used for this indication, although it appears to be relatively ineffective. The research is difficult to evaluate because of the heterogeneity of the products used in various studies. Ref: Kligler B: Echinacea. Am Fam Physician 2003;67(1):77-81.
