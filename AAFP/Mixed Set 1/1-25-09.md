25-hydroxyvitamin D

Recommendations to screen for vitamin D deficiency apply only to patients at risk and not to the general population. This patient’s obesity and her clothing style, which limits sun exposure to the skin, puts her at increased risk. Additionally, this patient’s muscle aches may be a symptom of vitamin D deficiency. The recommended test for this condition is a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. A 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level is recommended to monitor, not diagnose, certain conditions. Parathyroid hormone, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase levels are poor indicators of vitamin D status.
