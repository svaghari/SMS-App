propylthiouracil

Overt hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is associated with adverse effects to the mother and fetus, so treatment is required. Since methimazole is associated with birth defects when used in the first trimester, propylthiouracil is preferred. Methimazole should be considered after the first trimester because the risk of congenital anomalies is less than the risk of liver failure associated with propylthiouracil. Surgery and radioactive iodine should only be used if there is a clear indication, and radioactive iodine would not be appropriate during pregnancy.
