Administration of oxygen and immediate descent

The patient described initially showed signs of acute mountain sickness.  These include headache in an unacclimatized person who recently arrived at an elevation >2500 m (8200 ft), plus the presence of one or more of the following:  anorexia, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, dizziness, or fatigue.  The patient's condition then deteriorated to high-altitude cerebral edema, defined as the onset of ataxia and/or altered consciousness in someone with acute mountain sickness.  The management of choice is a combination of descent and supplemental oxygen.  Often, a descent of only 500-1000 m (1600-3300 ft) will lead to resolution of acute mountain sickness.  Simulated descent with a portable hyperbaric chamber also is effective, but descent should not be delayed while awaiting helicopter delivery.  If descent and/or administration of oxygen is not possible, medical therapy with dexamethasone and/or acetazolamide may reduce the severity of symptoms.  Nifedipine has also been shown to be helpful in cases of high-altitude pulmonary edema where descent and/or supplemental oxygen is unavailable. Ref: Hackett PH, Roach RC: High-altitude illness.
