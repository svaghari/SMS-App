Clopidogrel and aspirin for 1 year and then aspirin alone

Coronary artery stenting is a common procedure, and stent restenosis carries a high mortality rate. Current American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin with a second agent such as clopidogrel) for at least 12 months following the placement of a drug-eluting stent. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for more than 1 year gives no additional benefit and carries an additional risk of bleeding. Aspirin has been shown to be effective for the secondary prevention of heart disease and should be continued after 1 year.
