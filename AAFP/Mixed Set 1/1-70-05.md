Gastroesophageal reflux

Gastroesophageal reflux is a common cause of wheezing in infants. At 5 months of age, most infants no longer spit up several times a day, and this is a major clue that this childâ€™s wheezing may be from the reflux. In addition, there is no family history of asthma and the wheezing is not related to infections.Cystic fibrosis is more likely to present with recurrent infections and failure to thrive than with intermittent wheezing.
