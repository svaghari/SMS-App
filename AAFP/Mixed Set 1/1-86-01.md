Detrusor instability

Urinary incontinence is very common in the elderly female. Treatment depends entirely on a careful history to ascertain the exact circumstances when the patient wets herself. One of the most common types of incontinence results from uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle. This detrusor instability causes an intense urge to void, which overcomes the patientâ€™s voluntary attempt to hold the sphincter closed; hence, the common term urge incontinence. Other common causes of incontinence include a weak sphincter (sphincter incompetence), which leads to leakage associated with ordinary activities such as coughing or lifting (stress incontinence). Another common cause is overflow of urine from an abnormally distended, hypotonic, poorly contractile bladder (detrusor hypotonia). This is probably more common in males with longstanding obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy. A rare type of incontinence is caused by spinal cord damage. This reflex incontinence is due to the patient being unable to sense the need to void. Ref: Hazzard WR, Blass JP, Halter JB, et al (eds): Principles of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology, ed 5.
