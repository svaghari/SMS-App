He should be given 400 IU of supplemental vitamin D daily

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a daily intake of 400 IU of vitamin D in infants, children, and adolescents (SOR C). Breastfeeding does not provide adequate levels of vitamin D. Exclusive formula feeding probably provides adequate levels of vitamin D, but infants who consume less than 1 liter of formula per day need supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D daily. Vitamin D supplementation should be started within the first 2 months of life.
