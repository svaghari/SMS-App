Spironolactone (Aldactone)

For patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, clinical trials have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists decrease hospitalizations and all-cause mortality. In African-American patients, all-cause mortality and hospitalizations have been reduced by hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate.

Aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone, as well as β-blockers, decrease mortality in patients with symptomatic heart failure (SOR A). Digoxin improves symptoms of heart failure but does not improve mortality.
