50

To mitigate the risk of opioid harm, it is essential to understand morphine milligram equivalents (MME).
The evidence shows that the risk of an opioid overdose increases at the threshold of 50 MME/day. It is
therefore recommended by the CDC that a prescription for naloxone be ordered when an opioid dosage
reaches 50 MME/day, which is a high dosage. In general one should avoid prescribing 90 MME/day
because of the substantially higher risk of an overdose at this dosage level.
