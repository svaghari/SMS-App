bromocriptine (Parlodel)

This patient has a pituitary microadenoma. Microadenomas <10 mm in size that are secreting prolactin may be treated with a dopaminergic agent such as bromocriptine. This will lower the prolactin level and shrink the adenoma. Nonprolactin-secreting adenomas, especially those >10 mm in size (macroadenomas), require neurosurgical evaluation.
