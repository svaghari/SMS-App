A procalcitonin level

Using a procalcitonin-guided therapy algorithm reduces antibiotic use by 3.47 days without increasing either morbidity or mortality in adults with acute respiratory infections. If the procalcitonin level is <0.10 mg/dL, a bacterial infection is highly unlikely and it is strongly recommended that antibiotics not be prescribed. If the procalcitonin level is 0.10–0.24 mg/dL a bacterial infection is still unlikely and it is recommended that antibiotics not be used. If the level is 0.25–0.50 mg/dL a bacterial infection is likely and antibiotics are recommended. It is strongly recommended that antibiotics be given if the level is >0.50 mg/dL, because a bacterial infection is very likely.
