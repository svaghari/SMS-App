Hepatitis B

Late in 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention recommended hepatitis B vaccine for all previously unvaccinated adults between the ages of
19 and 59 with diabetes mellitus, as soon as possible after the diagnosis of diabetes is made. Vaccination
should be considered for patients ³ age 60, after assessing their risk and the likelihood of an adequate
immune response.
