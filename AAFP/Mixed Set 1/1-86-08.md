Supine, with the uterus manually deflected laterally

In general, it is best to place a woman who is greater than 20 weeks pregnant in the left lateral decubitus position because the uterus can compress the great vessels, resulting in decreased systolic blood pressure and uterine blood flow. However, in the case of trauma where a spinal cord injury cannot be ruled out, the woman needs to be kept supine on a backboard. The weight of the uterus can be shifted off the great vessels by either manual deflection laterally or by elevating the right hip 4â€“6 inches by placing towels under the backboard. The Trendelenburg position does not relieve the weight of the uterus on the great vessels. The prone position does not provide adequate spinal cord protection, and would be extremely awkward in a large pregnant woman. Ref: Advanced Trauma Life Support for Doctors, ed 3.
