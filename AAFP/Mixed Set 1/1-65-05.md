Pertussis

In the United States, deaths from pertussis increased from 4 deaths in 1996 to 17 deaths in 2001, and a total of 56 deaths from 2001 to 2003. Immunity has decreased in previously vaccinated adolescents and adults, and now they are a reservoir for infection. Tdap vaccine is recommended as a single booster for patients age 19–65, and those between the ages of 11 and 18 years should receive Tdap rather than a Td booster. The Tdap vaccine protects against pertussis, in addition to tetanus and diphtheria. Tetanus and rubella deaths are not increasing. There are no vaccines for hepatitis C or West Nile virus.
