A levonorgestrel-releasing IUD

IFew treatments for dysfunctional uterine bleeding have been studied. NSAIDs, oral contraceptive pills, and danazol have not been shown to have sufficient evidence of effect for the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Progestin is effective when used on a 21-day cycle, but not if used only during the luteal phase. Hysterectomy and ablation are very effective, but both eliminate fertility. In a young woman unsure about having children, the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD is the most effective treatment that preserves fertility (SOR A).
