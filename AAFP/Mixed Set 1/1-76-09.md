Schedule frequent office visits

Somatization disorders should be considered in patients who have a history of various complaints over a several-year period that involve multiple organ systems.  There is no test to confirm this diagnosis.  It is often intertwined in other psychiatric problems, including anxiety disorder, personality disorder, and depression.  Treatment includes testing to make sure that there is nothing physically wrong, while building a trusting relationship with the patient.  Once this is accomplished, it is reasonable to discuss the disorder with the patient.  Cognitive therapy has been shown to be of value, as well as regularly scheduled office visits for monitoring and support.  Medicines for coexisting psychiatric problems also are of benefit.  In addition, referral for psychiatric consultation may be worthwhile. Food allergies can cause a variety of symptoms, but usually not to the extent seen with this patient, and testing for this might confuse the issue.  Lorazepam may help the symptoms if there is a coexisting anxiety disorder, but it will not address the underlying problem.  Laryngeal esophageal reflux can cause hoarseness and will respond to proton pump inhibitors, but given the repetitive nature of her symptoms and the previous negative workups, it is not consistent with the whole picture.
