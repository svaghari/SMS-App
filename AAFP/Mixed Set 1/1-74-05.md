An empiric trial of a proton pump inhibitor

Chronic cough is defined as a cough lasting at least 8 weeks. If a thorough history (with attention to ACE inhibitor use), a physical examination, and a plain-film chest radiograph do not suggest an obvious cause for the cough, experts suggest that the three most common etiologies are gastroesophageal reflux, persistent postnasal drip, and unrecognized asthma. Treating a chronic cough empirically with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor for 2–3 months is considered a reasonable choice before further investigations are attempted. Ordering an esophageal pH probe or esophagogastroduodenoscopy would also be considered appropriate. Postnasal drip is often due to allergic rhinitis or another noninfectious condition and some guidelines recommend empiric nasal corticosteroid sprays and/or first-generation oral antihistamine use.
CT of the chest and bronchoscopy may become necessary if the evaluation and treatment for these three common conditions does not improve the patient’s symptoms. Since there are no symptoms of bacterial sinusitis, the use of a broad-spectrum antibiotic is not justified.
