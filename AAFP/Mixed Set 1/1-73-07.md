MRI of the brain

Certain drugs can affect taste more than smell, but this does not include the bisphosphonates. Olfactory disorders may be associated with deficiencies of vitamins A, B6, B12, and trace metals, but not with vitamin D deficiency. Celiac disease is not known to cause a decreased ability to smell. Rare tumors involving the olfactory region of the brain can affect smell, and are best detected by MRI.
