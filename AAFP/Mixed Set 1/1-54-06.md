Start empagliflozin (Jardiance)

Metformin should be used as first-line therapy in type 2 diabetes to reduce microvascular complications, assist in weight management, reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, and reduce the risk of mortality in patients (SOR A). Patients who are intolerant of metformin are unlikely to be successful with a third trial of that agent. Empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, is considered a second-line choice for patients who are intolerant of metformin. Both sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, and liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, should be avoided or used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis.
