Recommend the use of the telephone interpreting service as best medical practice

Physicians should use trained interpreters whenever possible to avoid mistakes and pitfalls associated with using family members or untrained interpreters for medical interviews. Simply being bilingual does not mean someone will be an appropriate interpreter. Although it is technically legal to use a nontrained interpreter for this patient, title VI of the Civil Rights Act requires interpreter services for all patients with limited English capabilities who are receiving federal assistance (except Medicare Part B). This patient does not have Medicaid, but ethically it would be appropriate to extend the same courtesy to her.

It is difficult to predict what may occur in any visit, and a physician is open to serious medical mistakes by assuming a visit does not require an interpreter, because the patient may bring up a serious medical issue. Confidentiality is a concern when using family members to interpret, since they may not have an understanding of the need for confidentiality. It is not appropriate to ask the patient through her family member about her preferences for interpreting.
