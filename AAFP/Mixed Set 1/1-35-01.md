Roseola infantum

This patient has the classic presentation for roseola infantum, which is caused by human herpesvirus 6. The typical history includes a high fever in a child with either mild upper respiratory symptoms or no other symptoms. After the fever subsides, a rash will appear. The rash is self-limited and no treatment is required.

Pityriasis rosea typically presents with a single herald patch that is oval-shaped and scaly with central clearing, followed by a symmetric rash on the trunk in a typical distribution along the Langer lines. The rash may last up to 12 weeks and no treatment is required.

Erythema infectiosum is caused by parvovirus B19 and is also known as fifth disease. The child will typically have mild symptoms then an erythematous facial rash that has a “slapped cheek” appearance. This is sometimes followed by pink patches and macules in a reticular pattern. Once the rash appears the child is no longer contagious.

Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus and is characterized by scattered flesh-colored papules with umbilicated centers. Atopic dermatitis typically presents as scaly, erythematous plaques, commonly on the flexor surfaces of the extremities.
