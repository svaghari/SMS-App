Induction of labor with oxytocin (Pitocin) if the cervix is favorable

This patient has hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome and needs to be delivered. There is no reason to delay delivery in a term pregnancy. HELLP syndrome is a form of severe preeclampsia. If the patient has a favorable cervical examination, labor induction with oxytocin is appropriate. If the cervix is unfavorable, cesarean delivery should be considered to expedite delivery. Ref: Gabbe SG, Niebyl JR, Simpson JL (eds): Obstetrics: Normal and Problem Pregnancies, ed 4.
