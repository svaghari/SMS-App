Application of estrogen cream to the site

The etiology of prepubertal labial adhesions is idiopathic. The adhesions may be partial or complete; in some cases only a small pinhole orifice may be seen that allows urine to exit from the fused labia. This problem may be asymptomatic, but the patient may also have a pulling sensation, difficulty with voiding, recurrent urinary tract infections, or vaginitis. If there is enough labial fusion to interfere with urination, treatment should be undertaken. The use of topical estrogen cream twice daily at the point of the midline fusion will usually result in resolution of the problem.
