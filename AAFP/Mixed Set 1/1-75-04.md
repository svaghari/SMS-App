Bile acids

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy classically presents as severe pruritus in the third trimester.  Characteristic findings include the absence of primary skin lesions and elevation of serum levels of total bile acids.  Jaundice and elevated bilirubin levels may or may not be present.  The GGT usually is normal or modestly elevated, which can help differentiate this condition from other cholestatic liver diseases.  The prothrombin time usually is normal, but if elevated it may reflect a vitamin K deficiency from malabsorption. Ref: Riely CA: Liver disease in the pregnant patient.
