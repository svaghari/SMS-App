Vitamin B6

Most pregnant women with a positive tuberculin skin test are asymptomatic and have no evidence of active tuberculosis, and therefore have latent tuberculosis infection. The risk of reactivation of tuberculosis and progression to active disease is the highest in the first 2 years of conversion. In women with a known conversion to a positive PPD in the last 2 years, treatment with isoniazid (INH), 300 mg daily, is recommended starting after the first trimester. Treatment should last 6â€“9 months. Pregnant women are at an increased risk for peripheral neuropathy when treated with INH. Vitamin B6 supplementation decreases the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy with the use of INH.
