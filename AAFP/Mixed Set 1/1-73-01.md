Factors associated with a higher risk of heat-related deaths include being confined to bed, not leaving home daily, and being unable to care for oneself.  Living alone during a heat wave is associated with an increased risk of death, but this increase is not statistically significant.  Among medical conditions, the highest risk is associated with preexisting psychiatric illnesses, followed by cardiovascular disease, use of psychotropic medications, and pulmonary disease. A lower risk of heat-related deaths has been noted in those who have working air conditioning, visit air-conditioned sites, or participate in social activities.  Those who take extra showers or baths and who use fans have a lower risk, but this difference is not statistically significant.
