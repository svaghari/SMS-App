A follow-up visit and a repeat chest radiograph in 6 months

Given this patientâ€™s age, lack of symptoms, and possible family history, the presence of asymptomatic
bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy most likely represents stage 1 pulmonary sarcoidosis. Because the patient
does not have any symptoms and stage 1 sarcoidosis resolves in most cases, the most prudent course is to
reevaluate her in 6 months with a careful history, a physical examination, and a chest radiograph. Given
the normal spirometry results, pulmonary function tests are not needed at this time. Neither CT nor a lung
biopsy would change management at this time. Treatment is not indicated in stage 1 sarcoidosis but would
be merited if she developed increasing pulmonary symptoms or any extrapulmonary symptoms.
