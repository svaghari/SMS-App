They prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea

A wealth of evidence-based research has established the benefits of probiotics, especially in children. Probiotics, particularly Saccharomyces boulardii , have been shown to prevent the antibiotic-associated diarrhea that occurs in 5%â€“30% of children who receive antibiotics (SOR A). The number needed to treat to prevent one case of diarrhea is 10.

Probiotics reduce the pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but have not been shown to be helpful in reducing diarrhea or constipation in pediatric IBS patients (SOR A).

In breastfed infants, probiotics reduce daily crying time by up to an hour. Similar benefits have not been found in formula-fed infants or infants who are combining breastfeeding and formula. Probiotics have not been shown to prevent colic in any infants.

Other benefits of probiotics include the prevention of eczema and upper respiratory infections (SOR A). However, their use has not been shown to prevent allergies and asthma.
