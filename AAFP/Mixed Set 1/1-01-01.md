Finasteride (Proscar)

Pharmacologic options for benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms include an α-adrenergic blocker, a 5-α-reductase inhibitor (if there is evidence of prostatic enlargement or a PSA level >1.5 ng/mL), a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, or antimuscarinic therapy. The first three have proven efficacy as monotherapies.
