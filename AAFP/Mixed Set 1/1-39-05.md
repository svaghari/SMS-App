Moderate physical activity for 150 minutes or more per week

Although pharmacologic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for hypertension in adults, there are several nonpharmacologic options that have been shown to lower blood pressure. Moderate exercise 3â€“4 times per week for 40 minutes or more has been shown to lower high blood pressure, with the greatest effect seen when patients exercise 150 minutes or more per week. Limiting sodium intake to 2400 mg/day decreases blood pressure, and further effects are seen when it is limited to 1500 mg/day. Alcohol should be limited to no more than two drinks per day in men, and one drink per day in women. Magnesium and coenzyme Q10 do not lower blood pressure.
