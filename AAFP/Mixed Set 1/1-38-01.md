Enterovirus infection

Most pericarditis is presumed to be viral in origin. Enteroviruses, herpesviruses, adenovirus, and parvovirus B19 are common agents. Tuberculosis infection is also possible in this patient, considering the high prevalence of tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa. Candida infection is much less common, especially in an HIV-negative patient. Postâ€“myocardial infarction syndrome, secondary metastatic tumor, and drug reaction are infrequent causes, especially in a previously healthy patient. Ibuprofen may be used to treat pericarditis.
