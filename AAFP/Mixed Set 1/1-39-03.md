Ciprofloxacin (Cipro)

Puncture wounds to the foot commonly get infected. Most soft-tissue infections from puncture wounds are caused by gram-positive organisms. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common, followed by other staphylococcal and streptococcal species. When the puncture wound is through the rubber sole of an athletic shoe, Pseudomonas is the most frequent pathogen. Ciprofloxacin is the only oral antibiotic that has antipseudomonal activity, and would be the most appropriate choice.
