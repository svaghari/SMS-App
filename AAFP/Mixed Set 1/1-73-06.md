Clindamycin (Cleocin)

This patient most likely has periodontitis of the toothâ€™s roots with cellulitis, complicated by an apical abscess.  This infection is caused by anaerobic oral bacteria.  Penicillin VK, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate is preferred for antibiotic treatment, but this patient is allergic to penicillin.  Clindamycin is a good choice to cover the likely pathogens.  Doxycycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and cephalexin have limited effectiveness against anaerobes and would not be indicated.
