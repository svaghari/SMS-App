Provide healthy foods for all meals and snacks, and end the meal if the child refuses to eat

It is estimated that 3%-10% of infants and toddlers refuse to eat according to their caregivers.  Unlike other feeding problems such as colic, this problem tends to persist without intervention.  It is recommended that caregivers establish food rules, such as healthy scheduled meals and snacks, and apply them consistently.  Parents should control what, when, and where children are being fed, whereas children should control how much they eat at any given time in accordance with physiologic signals of hunger and fullness.  No food or drinks other than water should be offered between meals or snacks.  Food should not be offered as a reward or present.  Parents can be reassured that a normal child will learn to eat enough to prevent starvation.  If malnutrition does occur, a search for a physical or mental abnormality should be sought.
