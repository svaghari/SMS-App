Routine episiotomy

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the cause of one-fourth of maternal deaths worldwide and 12% in the United States. It is defined as the loss of 1000 mL of blood or the loss of blood with coinciding signs and symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 hours after delivery. Twenty percent of PPH occurs in patients without risk factors, so methods to prevent this common problem should be in place with every delivery.
Active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL) is crucial in the prevention of PPH. Administering oxytocin with or soon after the delivery of the anterior shoulder is the most important step of this process (SOR A). Even if oxytocin is used for induction, or as a part of AMTSL, it is still the most effective treatment for PPH (SOR A). Controlled cord traction is part of AMTSL and is necessary for the delivery of the placenta. If a retained placenta occurs it may be necessary to manually remove the placenta with necessary anesthesia. Trauma such as lacerations and episiotomies increases the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, so routine episiotomy should be avoided (SOR A).
