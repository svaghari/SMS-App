Stopping ranitidine and repeating the CBC in 2 weeks

Thrombocytopenia is a relatively common dyscrasia often discovered through routine laboratory studies. There are many causes of thrombocytopenia but medication-induced thrombocytopenia should always be considered. In this case the patient is taking an H2-blocker that may cause blood dyscrasias. The offending agent should be stopped and a repeat level should be obtained in 2–4 weeks for patients with mild asymptomatic thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100,000–150,000/mm3) and in 1–2 weeks for moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count 50,000–100,000/mm3) (SOR C). Prednisone is the
first-line treatment for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (SOR C); however in this situation, it is reasonable to look for other causes first. If the thrombocytopenia is worse on repeat testing (<100,000/mm3) it is reasonable to consider consultation for further evaluation and to consider a bone marrow biopsy. If the platelet count improves, continued monitoring is indicated until it returns to normal. Platelet transfusions are not indicated in stable, nonbleeding patients unless the platelet count drops below 10,000/mm3.
