medication discrepancies

Maintaining and communicating accurate patient medication information is one of the goals of the Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals program. This includes medication reconciliation, which is intended to identify and resolve discrepancies. In this process, a clinician compares the medications a patient should be using and is actually using with the new medications that are ordered. While adverse drug effects, potentially inappropriate medication use in the elderly, high-risk medication use, or polypharmacy might also occur and might be beneficial to address, these are not the primary focus of medication reconciliation.
