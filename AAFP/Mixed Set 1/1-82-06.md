No solid food for 8 hours prior to surgery and clear liquids until 2 hours prior to surgery

Recent American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines recommend the following restrictions on diet prior to surgery for pediatric patients: 8 hours for solid food, 6 hours for formula, 4 hours for breast milk, and 2 hours for clear liquids. These changes have resulted in decreased numbers of canceled cases and pediatric patients who are less irritable preoperatively and less dehydrated at the time of anesthesia induction.
