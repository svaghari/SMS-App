Order a brain MRI with enhancement and emphasis on the pituitary fossa

Galactorrhea associated with a prolactin level >200 Î¼g/L usually indicates a prolactinoma, and requires MRI of the pituitary with gadolinium enhancement. Many drugs can cause galactorrhea, including oral contraceptives and risperidone, but they would not elevate serum prolactin to this level. Dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine or cabergoline are the preferred treatment for most patients with hyperprolactinemia. Ref: Leung AKC, Pacaud D: Diagnosis and management of galactorrhea.
