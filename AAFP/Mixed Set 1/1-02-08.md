Further evaluation for depression

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends depression screening for all adolescents 12â€“18 years of age. Although this patient has abdominal pain, the history and physical examination suggest that depression may be playing a role in her somatic complaints. She had a positive initial depression screen on her PHQ-2. This is a brief screening tool, and a positive result merits further evaluation. The evaluation should include a full PHQ-A or a discussion with a qualified clinician. If the patient meets the criteria for major depressive disorder then she should receive treatment for her depression, which could include medication. Both fluoxetine and citalopram have been approved by the FDA to treat depression in this age group. She could also be referred for psychotherapy. Further laboratory studies and imaging may be appropriate at some point, but the most urgent need is to evaluate her positive depression screen.
