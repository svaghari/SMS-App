Ascorbic acid

This patient has iron deficiency anemia. There are several substances that decrease the absorption of iron, including antacids, soy protein, calcium, tannin (which is in tea), and phytate (which is found in bran). Since an acidic environment increases iron absorption, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can enhance absorption of an iron supplement. Ref: Goldman L, Ausiello D (eds): Cecil Textbook of Medicine, ed 22.
