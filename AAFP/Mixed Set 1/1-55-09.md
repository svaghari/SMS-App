3000 mL over 3 hours

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends that patients with elevated serum lactate or hypotension receive isotonic intravenous fluids such as normal saline or lactated Ringerâ€™s solution at an initial rate of 30 mL/kg in the first 3 hours using small boluses of approximately 500 mL. A serum lactate value >36 g/dL (4 mmol/L) is correlated with increased severity of illness and poorer outcomes even if hypotension is not yet present. Patients who are hypotensive or whose serum lactate level is >36 g/dL require intravenous fluids or colloid to expand their circulating volume and effectively restore perfusion pressure. The administration of 30 mL/kg of fluid is recommended as a fluid challenge, which should be started as early as possible in the course of septic shock.
