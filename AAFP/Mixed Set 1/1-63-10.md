It does not enhance either performance or muscle strength

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is illegal under the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, and is prohibited by the NCAA and the International Olympic Committee. Like androstenedione, DHEA is a precursor to testosterone, but neither of these substances has been shown to enhance either performance or strength. In fact, they increase serum estrogen and luteinizing hormone levels.
