Urinary free cortisol

In a patient presenting with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hirsutism, who also has thin skin and osteopenia, an elevated 24-hour collection showing high urinary free cortisol confirms the presence of Cushing syndrome. The dexamethasone suppression test, though still commonly used, no longer has a place in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with Cushing syndrome. Corticotropin-dependent and corticotropin-independent causes of Cushing syndrome can be separated by measuring plasma corticotropin. Plasma free cortisol measurements should be obtained only to determine the success or failure of transsphenoidal microadenomectomy or adrenalectomy. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling is used to confirm the source of corticotropin secretion before surgical intervention.
