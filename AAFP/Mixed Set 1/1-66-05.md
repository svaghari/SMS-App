Allow the rash to resolve without further treatment

Granuloma annulare is a self-limited condition. It is not contagious, and therefore would not need to be covered to prevent transmission. Treatments may include injected or topical corticosteroids, but oral corticosteroids have not been specifically recommended. It may be necessary to refer the patient to a dermatologist because many of the potential treatments can have serious side effects.
