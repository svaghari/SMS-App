Epinephrine

This patient has symptoms of anaphylaxis. Symptoms include an acute onset (minutes to several hours); involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both; plus one of the following: respiratory compromise (dyspnea, wheezing, bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia), reduced blood pressure, or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence).

The first and most important treatment in anaphylaxis is intramuscular epinephrine, 1:1000 dilution dosed at 0.01 mg/kg (maximal dose of 0.3 mg in children and 0.5 mg in adults) (SOR B). Management of the airway, breathing, and circulation is also essential (SOR B).

Other essential treatments include volume replacement with normal saline for the treatment of hypotension that does not respond to epinephrine (SOR B). Histamine H1-receptor antagonists such as diphenhydramine and corticosteroids may be considered as second-line treatments in patients with anaphylaxis (SOR C). Glucagon can be considered for patients who are taking Î²-blockers.
