Restart the patient’s previous antihypertensive medications and follow up within 1 week

This patient has severe asymptomatic hypertension (systolic blood pressure 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 110 mm Hg). If there were signs or symptoms of acute target organ injury, such as neurologic deficits, altered mental status, chest pain, shortness of breath, or oliguria, hospitalization for a hypertensive emergency would be indicated. Because this patient was asymptomatic and has a known history of hypertension, restarting his prior antihypertensive regimen and following up in 2 weeks would be the most appropriate management option. If he had no past history of hypertension it would be reasonable to consider out-of-office monitoring with an ambulatory device for 2 weeks before initiating treatment. In the absence of acute target organ injury, blood pressure should be gradually lowered to less than 160/100 mm Hg over several days to weeks. Aggressively lowering blood pressure can lead to adverse events such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or syncope, so administering a short-acting antihypertensive medication in the office should be reserved for the management of hypertensive emergencies.
