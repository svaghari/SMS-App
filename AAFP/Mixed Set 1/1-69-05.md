Staphylococcus

This is a typical presentation of staphylococcal food poisoning. The symptoms usually begin 1–6 hours after ingestion and resolve within 24–48 hours. Foodborne botulism is most commonly found in homecanned foods, and symptoms begin 18–36 hours after ingestion. Clostridium perfringens is transmitted in feces and water, and symptoms begin 6–24 hours after ingestion. Clostridium difficile is associated with antibiotic use. Actinomycosis causes local abscesses, not gastroenteritis.
