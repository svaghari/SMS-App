A central DXA scan of the lumbar spine and hips

This patient has several risk factors for osteoporosis: Asian ethnicity, low body weight, positive family history, postmenopausal status with no history of hormone replacement, and low calcium intake. The best diagnostic test for osteoporosis is a central DXA scan of the hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine. Quantitative CT is accurate, but cost and radiation exposure are issues. Peripheral DXA and calcaneal sonography results do not correlate well with central DXA. Measurement of biochemical markers is not recommended for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.
