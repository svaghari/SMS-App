Aortic insufficiency

This adolescent has findings of Marfan syndrome. It is associated with arachnodactyly, an arm span greater than height, a high arched palate, kyphosis, lenticular dislocation, mitral valve prolapse, myopia, and pectus excavatum. The cardiac examination may reveal an aortic insufficiency murmur, or a murmur associated with mitral valve prolapse. Cardiovascular defects are progressive, and aortic root dilation occurs in 80%â€“100% of affected individuals. Aortic regurgitation becomes more common with increasing age.
