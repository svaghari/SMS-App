Immediately

Head lice are a common and easily treated inconvenience in school-aged children that, unlike body lice,
are not associated with significant illnesses. Transmission generally requires head-to-head contact, as lice
cannot survive when separated from their host for more than 24 hours and do not fly or hop. Visible nits
are generally present at the time of diagnosis, confirming that the infestation has been present for some
time, so immediate isolation from other children would not be expected to change the natural course of
events. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children found to be infested with
lice remain in class but be discouraged from close contact with others until treated appropriately with a
pediculicide. The AAP position also recommends abandonment of “no nits” school policies, which prohibit
attendance until no visible nits are identified. Nits can be found long after their deposition at the scalp level
and generally have already hatched by the time they are easily noted at some distance from the scalp.
