Personal contact

The scabies mite is predominantly transmitted by direct personal contact. Infestation from indirect contact with clothing or bedding is believed to be infrequent. Hats are frequent transmitters of head lice, but not scabies. Ref: Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, et al (eds): Harrisonâ€™s Principles of Internal Medicine, ed 16. McGraw-Hill, 2005, pp 2600-2606.
