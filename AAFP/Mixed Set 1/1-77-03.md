Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant

Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant is recommended as the initial imaging study for right upper quadrant pain (SOR C). KUB films can detect kidney stones but may miss gallstones. CT also may miss gallstones, and is more invasive than ultrasonography. Abdominal CT with intravenous contrast is the preferred test for right lower quadrant pain, and abdominal CT with intravenous and oral contrast is preferred for left lower quadrant pain. MRI is preferred for detecting tumors, and is inappropriate as the initial imaging study for right upper quadrant pain.
