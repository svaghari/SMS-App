There is a strong association with diabetes mellitus

Dupuytren’s disease is characterized by shortening and thickening of the palmar fascia. It is initially asymptomatic, but may progress and cause difficulty with function of the hand, and may eventually lead to contracture. Early asymptomatic disease does not require treatment. A series of cortisone injections over a period of months may lead to disease regression, and is useful in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Surgery is indicated if a metacarpal joint contracture reaches 30°, or with a proximal interphalangeal joint contracture of any degree. If surgery is delayed, irreversible joint contracture may occur.
There is a strong association between diabetes mellitus and Dupuytren’s disease, with up to a third of diabetic patients having evidence of the disease. It is also associated with alcohol use and smoking. Patients requiring surgery have an increased risk of dying from cancer, probably related to smoking, alcohol use, or diabetes mellitus, but a search for cancer at the time of diagnosis is not indicated.
