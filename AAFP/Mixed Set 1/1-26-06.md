Isosorbide mononitrate

In addition to aspirin, a high-intensity statin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, patients with chronic stable angina may be treated with β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and/or long-acting nitrates. β-Blockers and heart rate–lowering calcium channel blockers should be avoided in this patient who already has bradycardia. Ranolazine, which affects myocardial metabolism, is not used as a first-line agent. Ivabradine is not a first-line agent and is used only in patients with heart failure. A long-acting nitrate or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker would be appropriate for this patient.
