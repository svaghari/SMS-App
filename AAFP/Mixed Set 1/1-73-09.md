The most likely diagnosis is Gilbert syndrome

Gilbert syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by indirect hyperbilirubinemia caused by impaired glucuronyl transferase activity.  The workup includes studies to exclude hemolysis (CBC, reticulocyte count, and haptoglobin) and liver disease (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and prothrombin time).  Alcoholic liver disease is associated with a greater elevation of AST than of ALT.  Dubin-Johhnson syndrome is a benign liver disease distinguished by direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.  Imaging studies are not required to confirm Gilbert syndrome; such studies are more useful for conditions involving conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.  Other causes of indirect hyperbilirubinemia include hematoma, infection, cardiac disease, rhabdomyolysis, living at high altitude, thyrotoxicosis, and some medications.
