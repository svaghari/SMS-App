No screening at this visit

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for cervical cancer for women
younger than 21, for women over the age of 65 who have had adequate screening in the recent past and
are not at high risk, and for women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and no
history of CIN 2 or 3 or cervical cancer (USPSTF D recommendation). Women between the ages of 21
and 65 can be screened every 3 years with cytology alone, or the interval can be increased to 5 years after
age 30 by using a combination of cytology and HPV testing (USPSTF A recommendation). The history
of HPV vaccination is not a factor in screening decisions. Other organizations such as the American
Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have similar guidelines.
