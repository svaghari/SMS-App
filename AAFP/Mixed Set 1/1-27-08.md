Metoclopramide (Reglan)

This patient’s history fits the diagnosis of functional dyspepsia. Two subtypes of this disorder have been described. The first, epigastric pain syndrome, is described as intermittent pain and burning in the epigastrium. The second, postprandial distress syndrome, is more typical of the symptoms this patient describes: postprandial fullness and early satiety. Although there is considerable benefit from reassurance and “naming” a patient’s condition, empiric treatment is also warranted. Patients with epigastric pain syndrome are more likely to respond to proton pump inhibitors or H2-blockers. Patients with predominantly postprandial distress symptoms are more likely to improve with a motility agent such as metoclopramide. Sucralfate, antacids, and selective antidepressants have not been shown to be more effective than placebo in functional dyspepsia, whereas tricyclic antidepressants and buspirone have shown some benefit and are reasonable next steps for this patient.
