Cystoscopy

Asymptomatic microhematuria is defined as 3 or more RBCs/hpf on a properly collected urine specimen in the absence of an obvious benign cause. Vigorous exercise, viral illness, trauma, and infection have been ruled out as a cause of hematuria in this patient. His renal function is normal. The most appropriate next step in evaluating a patient ï‚³35 years of age is to perform a urologic evaluation with cystoscopy. Cystoscopy is also recommended for patients of any age who have risk factors for urinary tract malignancy.

The initial examination should also include CT urography with and without contrast. When CT with contrast is contraindicated, an alternative is retrograde pyelography in conjunction with noncontrast CT, MR urography, or ultrasonography. Obtaining urine cytology and urine markers is not recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria. A repeat urinalysis with microscopy is not needed to confirm asymptomatic microhematuria. According to the American Urological Association, one positive urine sample is sufficient to prompt an evaluation.
