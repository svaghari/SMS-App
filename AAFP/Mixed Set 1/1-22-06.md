Fluoxetine (Prozac), 20 mg daily

This patient has diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There are many treatments available, with varying degrees of evidence. SSRIs, along with tricyclic antidepressants, have been shown to decrease abdominal pain and improve global assessment scores in those with IBS. Polyethylene glycol is a treatment for constipation and would not help this patient. Acupuncture has not been shown to be superior to sham acupuncture in improving IBS symptoms. Neomycin has been shown to improve symptoms in constipation-predominant IBS but would not be helpful in diarrhea-predominant IBS. Soluble fiber such as psyllium improves symptoms and decreases abdominal pain scores in patients with IBS. Insoluble fiber has not been shown to improve any IBS outcomes.
