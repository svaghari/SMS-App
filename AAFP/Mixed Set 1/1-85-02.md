Oral valacyclovir (Valtrex)

The rash described is typical of herpes zoster. This commonly occurs in older individuals who have had chickenpox in childhood. The treatment of choice for acute herpes zoster is oral antiviral agents. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir have all been shown to be efficacious with 7 days of oral treatment. Studies suggest that valacyclovir may be superior to acyclovir in decreasing both acute and postherpetic pain. Famciclovir appears to be equal in efficacy to valacyclovir. Topical acyclovir may be effective for more limited forms of herpes simplex, but is usually not effective for herpes zoster. Topical and oral corticosteroids may have some use for combatting the inflammatory process, and may decrease the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia in certain individuals. Topical capsaicin may be useful in treating the pain of acute herpes zoster infection, as well as postherpetic neuralgia.
