The majority of cases resolve without treatment

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders occur in a large number of adults.  The etiology is varied, but includes dental malocclusion, bruxism (teeth grinding), anxiety, stress disorders, and, rarely, rheumatoid arthritis.  Dental occlusion problems, once thought to be the primary etiology, are not more common in persons with TMJ disorder.  While dental splints have been commonly recommended, the evidence for and against their use is insufficient to make a recommendation either way.  Physical therapy modalities such as iontophoresis or phonophoresis may benefit some patients, but there is no clearly preferred treatment.  Radiologic imaging is unnecessary in the vast majority of patients, and should therefore be reserved for chronic or severe cases.  In fact, the majority of patients with TMJ disorders have spontaneous resolution of symptoms, so noninvasive symptomatic treatments and tincture of time are the best approach for most.
