a minimum of 30 minutes at least 5 days/week

Because glycogen is the primary energy source for muscles during the first 20 minutes of exercise, at least 30 minutes of exercise is necessary to begin burning fat stores. The CDC and the American College of Sports Medicine recommend a minimum of 30 minutes of exercise 5 days per week. Twenty minutes of exercise daily or three 10-minute sessions daily does improve cardiovascular fitness, but does not cause significant weight loss. Walking, on land or in water, and stationary biking are equivalent in benefit.
