having the parents sign a refusal to vaccinate form

Experts recommend that a refusal to vaccinate form be signed by patients or parents who refuse a recommended vaccine. This form should document that the patient/parents were provided the vaccine information statement (SOR C). The CDC recommends against dismissing a patient or family from a practice if they refuse vaccination. Physicians should continue to discuss the benefits of immunizations at subsequent visits, because some patients/parents may reconsider their decision not to vaccinate.
