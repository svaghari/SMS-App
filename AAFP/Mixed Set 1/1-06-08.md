Administering the PHQ-9 screening questionnaire

This elderly patient is exhibiting classic signs of depression. The PHQ-2 has a similar sensitivity to the PHQ-9, but the PHQ-9 has a higher specificity in diagnosing depression (91%-94% compared to 78%-92%) and can assist in diagnosing depression. In addition to the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 there are specific screening tools for use in the elderly population, including the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Somatic issues and dementia can make it more difficult to screen for and diagnose depression in this population. The CAGE questionnaire screens for substance abuse. Megestrol is used to stimulate the appetite, but in this patient the appetite symptoms are likely secondary to depression so treating the depression would be a more appropriate starting point. The tricyclic nortriptyline is used to treat depression but is not first-line therapy, especially in the elderly. In general, a more extensive medical history and a physical examination are indicated before ordering MRI of the brain.
