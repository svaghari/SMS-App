Low-dose helical (spiral) noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis

Because many radiologic options are available for detecting suspected urolithiasis, and many contexts might affect their use, the American College of Radiology established appropriateness criteria to aid the selection process. These guidelines rate the appropriateness of CT, ultrasonography, radiography, and MRI for three categories of patients: (1) those presenting with a suspected stone, (2) those with recurrent stone symptoms, and (3) those with abdominal pain in pregnancy. Each modality is rated on a scale from 9 (most appropriate) to 1 (least appropriate).

For suspected stone disease in the case presented, the most appropriate imaging modality is helical (spiral) noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis with a rating of 8 (usually appropriate). Standard CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast has an appropriateness rating of 2 (usually not appropriate). Abdominal radiography (KUB) has an appropriateness rating of 3 (usually not appropriate). MRI of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast has a rating of 4 (may be appropriate). Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder is appropriate in pregnancy, but in the case presented it is given an appropriateness rating of 6 (may be appropriate).
