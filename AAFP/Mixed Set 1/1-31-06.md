Minoxidil 2% (Rogaine), applied to the scalp twice daily

Female pattern hair loss is categorized as diffuse and nonscarring. It presents with parietal hair thinning with preservation of the frontal hairline. Minoxidil 2% produces regrowth of hair in female pattern hair loss (SOR B). Oral finasteride is appropriate only for men with male pattern hair loss (SOR A). Hydroxychloroquine is used for inflammatory hair loss associated with discoid lupus erythematosus, which is focal and scarring. Topical corticosteroids are appropriate for alopecia areata (SOR B) but not for female pattern hair loss. Griseofulvin is used to treat tinea capitis, which presents as focal scale with erythema.
