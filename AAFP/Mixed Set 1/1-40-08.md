A GLP-1 agonist such as liraglutide (Victoza)

Of the options given, only a GLP-1 agonist such as liraglutide could be used for this patient because of his comorbidities of chronic kidney disease and heart failure. Metformin is contraindicated in males with a creatinine level >1.5 mg/dL and in females with a creatinine level >1.4 mg/dL. SGLT2 inhibitors are not as safe or effective if the patientâ€™s estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is <50 mL/min/1.73 m2, and it is not recommended in patients with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. The initiation of rosiglitazone is contraindicated in patients with established New York Heart Association class III or class IV heart failure.
