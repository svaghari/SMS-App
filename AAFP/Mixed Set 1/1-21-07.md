Pes anserine bursitis

This patient has medial knee pain related to repetitive use, most likely caused by pes anserine bursitis.
Iliotibial band syndrome is often related to overuse but causes pain in the lateral knee. The fibular head
is also lateral to the knee joint. Osgood-Schlatter disease is also often related to overuse but causes pain
at the insertion of the patellar ligament on the midline proximal tibia. A medial meniscal tear would
localize to the medial joint line rather than distal to the joint line and would more likely be associated with
positive findings from other examinations, such as a McMurray test.
