Upper endoscopy

Dysphagia alone or with unintentional weight loss is the most common presenting symptom of esophageal cancer. Adenocarcinoma is the most common esophageal cancer in developed nations, and risk factors include GERD, obesity, and tobacco abuse. Upper endoscopy is the recommended diagnostic tool (SOR B). If cancer is confirmed, CT and PET scanning are useful for staging.
