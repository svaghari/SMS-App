Henoch-Schonlein purpura

Henoch-Schonlein purpura typically follows an upper respiratory tract infection, and presents with low-grade fever, fatigue, arthralgia, and colicky abdominal pain. The hallmark of the disease is the rash, which begins as pink maculopapules, progresses to petechiae or purpura, which are clinically palpable, and changes in color from red to dusty brown before fading. Arthritis, usually involving the knees and ankles, is present in two-thirds of cases, and gastrointestinal tract involvement results in heme-positive stools in 50% of cases. Laboratory findings are not specific or diagnostic, and include indications of mild to moderate thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and anemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Treatment is typically symptomatic and supportive, although corticosteroids are indicated in the rare patient with life-threatening gastrointestinal or central nervous system manifestations. Systemic juvenile-onset rheumatoid arthritis usually presents with an evanescent salmon-pink rash. Rocky Mountain spotted fever does not present with arthritis and the rash begins distally on the legs. Iron ingestion does not typically cause a rash, fever, or arthritis. Disseminated anthrax does not present with a rash and joint symptoms. Ref: Behrman RE, Kliegman RM, Jenson HB (eds): Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, ed 17. Saunders, 2004, pp 826-828, 1674.
