The left atrium

If atrial fibrillation is converted back to sinus rhythm, the likelihood of the patient staying in sinus rhythm is best predicted from the diameter of the left atrium on the patientâ€™s echocardiogram. Significant left atrium enlargement means the patient is unlikely to stay in sinus rhythm after successful conversion.

Other factors that predict a lack of success in maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion include a longer time in atrial fibrillation before cardioversion, or the presence of underlying heart disease, especially rheumatic heart disease.
