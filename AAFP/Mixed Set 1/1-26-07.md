Cubital tunnel syndrome

This patient has signs and symptoms of cubital tunnel syndrome, which is the second most common peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms develop because of ulnar nerve compression in the upper extremity, leading to sensory paresthesias in the ulnar digits and intrinsic muscular weakness. Vague motor problems, including poor coordination of the fingers and hand clumsiness, are frequent complaints. Provocative testing includes demonstration of Tinel’s sign over the cubital tunnel, and the elbow flexion test with paresthesias elicited over the ulnar nerve.

Carpal tunnel syndrome causes paresthesias in the distal median nerve distribution. Wartenberg’s syndrome reflects compression of the superficial radial nerve. Pronator syndrome is a proximal median nerve neuropathy, while anterior interosseous nerve syndrome, a rare clinical entity, causes paresis or paralysis of the flexor pollicis longus, and the flexor digitorum profundus of the index and long fingers.
