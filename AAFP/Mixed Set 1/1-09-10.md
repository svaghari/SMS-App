Chronic rhinosinusitis

The American Academy of Otolaryngology defines chronic rhinosinusitis as the presence of two of four
cardinal symptoms, which include nasal drainage, nasal obstruction, facial pain or pressure, and hyposmia
or anosmia, along with objective signs on examination or radiographic studies. This patient has three
cardinal symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis and objective evidence on the physical examination. No nasal
polyps were seen on the examination. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and sarcoidosis can both present
similarly but are uncommon causes of chronic rhinosinusitis. Allergic rhinitis can be associated with
chronic rhinosinusitis but would also present with allergic symptoms.
