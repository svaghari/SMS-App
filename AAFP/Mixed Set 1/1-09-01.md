A fasting basic metabolic panel, a lipid profile, and a urinalysis

In a pediatric patient, blood pressure should be evaluated using comparisons based on age, sex, and height. Although this adolescent’s blood pressure is prehypertensive for an adult according to JNC 8 guidelines, it is stage 1 hypertension (between 95% and 99%) for her age, sex, and height. All pediatric patients with confirmed hypertension should have further evaluation to check for renal dysfunction as well as other cardiac risk factors. Additionally, renal ultrasonography is recommended to evaluate for renal disease and echocardiography to evaluate for end-organ damage that would affect treatment goals. Additional studies, such as plasma renin and catecholamine levels or renovascular imaging, may be indicated in children with abnormalities on initial evaluation that suggest secondary causes of hypertension.
Pharmacologic therapy is usually recommended for pediatric patients with symptomatic hypertension, secondary hypertension, target organ damage, diabetes mellitus, or persistent hypertension in spite of nonpharmacologic treatment. A low-sodium diet may be helpful for decreasing blood pressure, and given this patient’s obesity, intensive counseling about lifestyle changes is appropriate.
