Decreased sensation over the palmar aspect of the thumb, index, and middle finger

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity. It is caused by compression of the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Classically, patients with this condition experience pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve, which includes the palmar aspect of the thumb, index, and middle fingers, and the radial half of the ring finger. In more severe cases motor fibers are affected, leading to weakness of thumb abduction and opposition. Sensation over the thenar eminence should be normal in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome because it is in the distribution of the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, which branches off proximal to the carpal tunnel.
