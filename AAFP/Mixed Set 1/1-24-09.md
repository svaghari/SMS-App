provide some pain reduction

Fibromyalgia is a chronic complex condition characterized by muscle pain, fatigue, muscle tenderness, and sleep disorders, often accompanied by mood disorders. SSRIs have been studied in the treatment of these symptoms, and while they have been shown to produce up to a 30% reduction in pain scores in patients with fibromyalgia, they have not been shown to affect fatigue or sleeping problems. They also have not been shown to be superior to tricyclics when treating pain. As with other patient populations, SSRIs have been shown to improve depression in those with fibromyalgia.
