Topical antibiotics

This is a common presentation for acute paronychia, which typically is caused by local trauma to the nail fold or cuticle, with resulting inoculation and infection. Topical antibiotics, with or without topical corticosteroids, is one treatment option. Other options include warm compresses, oral antibiotics, and incision and drainage; however, incision and drainage is not always necessary. Removal of the proximal nail fold is used to treat chronic paronychia that is not responsive to other treatments. Topical corticosteroids can be used alone for chronic paronychia, but if used for acute paronychia, they should be combined with antibiotics since acute paronychia is typically caused by a bacterial infection. Topical antifungals are a treatment option for chronic paronychia, which can be associated with a fungal infection, but not for acute paronychia.
