FSH and LH levels

TIn men who are diagnosed with hypogonadism with symptoms of testosterone deficiency and unequivocally
and consistently low serum testosterone concentrations, further evaluation with FSH and LH levels is
advised as the initial workup to distinguish between primary and secondary hypogonadism. If secondary
hypogonadism is indicated by low or inappropriately normal FSH and LH levels, prolactin and serum iron
levels and measurement of total iron binding capacity are recommended to determine secondary causes of
hypogonadism, with possible further evaluation to include other pituitary hormone levels and MRI of the
pituitary. If primary hypogonadism is found, karyotyping may be indicated for Klinefelterâ€™s syndrome.
