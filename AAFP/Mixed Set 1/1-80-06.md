Hyponatremia

The adaptation that permits survival in chronic hyponatremia also makes the brain vulnerable to injury from overzealous therapy.  When hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly, outpacing the brains ability to recapture lost organic osmolytes, osmotic demyelination can result.  Osmotic demyelination syndrome can usually be avoided by limiting correction of chronic hyponatremia to <10-12 mmol/L in 24 hours and to <18 mmol/L in 48 hours.
