Physical therapy for quadriceps strengthening

Quadriceps-strengthening exercises have been shown in good studies to stabilize the knee and reduce pain for patients with degenerative arthritis. Acetaminophen has not been shown to produce clinically significant improvement from baseline pain. Intra-articular corticosteroids can acutely relieve pain and effusions but do not affect moderate-term outcomes. Hylan GF 20 products are minimally effective. Opiates and other similar drugs are addictive and should be avoided.
