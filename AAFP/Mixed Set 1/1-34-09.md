Treat him and the rest of the students in the dormitory with a single dose of ciprofloxacin (Cipro)

Postexposure prophylaxis after exposure to invasive meningococcal disease is indicated for any close contact regardless of immunization status. Close contacts include those exposed in households, dormitories, or day care centers, and those who have direct contact with oral secretions. There are several options for prophylaxis, including ciprofloxacin, 500 mg orally one time; azithromycin, 500 mg orally one time; ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly one time; or rifampin, 600 mg orally twice daily for 2 days. Treatment should begin as soon as possible after exposure but no later than 14 days. While rifampin can be used for postexposure prophylaxis, a one-time dose is not adequate. This patient is at risk of infection due to his close contact with the source patient. Postexposure prophylaxis is indicated even for vaccinated patients.
