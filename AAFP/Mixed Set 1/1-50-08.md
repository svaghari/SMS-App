start a statin immediately to decrease her risk of cardiovascular disease and perioperative mortality

Family physicians are often consulted for perioperative medical management. Studies have shown decreased perioperative mortality in patients who continue statins and in patients with clinical indications for statin therapy who start statins prior to undergoing vascular or high-risk surgeries such as joint replacement. A meta-analysis of 223,000 patients showed a significant reduction in perioperative mortality in patients receiving statin therapy versus placebo who underwent noncardiac surgical procedures. This patient has a clinical indication (multiple risk factors) to start statin therapy now.
