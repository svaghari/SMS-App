Cognitive therapy

Methamphetamine dependence is very difficult to treat.  No medications have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of this problem, nor have any studies shown consistent benefit to date.  The standard therapy for methamphetamine dependence is outpatient behavioral therapies, especially with case management included.  Therapy must be individualized.  Support groups and 12-step drug-treatment programs may be helpful. Ref: Winslow BT, Voorhees KI, Pehl KA: Methamphetamine abuse. Am Fam Physician 2007;76(8):1169-1174.
