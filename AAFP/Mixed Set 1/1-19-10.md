A nonsolid “ground glass” appearance

Characteristics that are more commonly associated with malignant lesions include a nonsolid “ground
glass” appearance, a size >6 mm, noncalcified lesions, a lesion size or volume doubling time between 1
month and 1 year, and irregular or spiculated borders. Findings on a chest radiograph that are more
commonly associated with benign lesions include a lesion size <6 mm, concentric or “popcorn-like”
calcifications, doubling times of <1 month or >2–4 years, dense solid-appearing lesions, and lesions with
smooth regular borders. Other diagnostic imaging modalities are also utilized, including CT and PET, and
a biopsy is sometimes necessary to establish the diagnosis. Chest radiographs are still useful for monitoring
patients with multiple findings that correlate most often with benign lesions. Informed decision making by
the patient and family physician can sensibly guide the follow-up of patients with solitary pulmonary
nodules without automatically referring them to specialists or ordering the most sophisticated imaging.
