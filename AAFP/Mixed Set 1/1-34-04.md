Norepinephrine (Levophed)

In a patient with sepsis, vasopressors are indicated when fluid resuscitation does not restore organ perfusion and blood pressure. Norepinephrine and dopamine are the preferred pressor agents; however, norepinephrine appears to be more effective and has a lower mortality rate. Norepinephrine is the preferred drug for shock due to sepsis. Its relative safety suggests that it be used as an initial vasopressor. It is a potent vasoconstrictor and inotropic stimulant and is useful for shock. As a first-line therapy norepinephrine is associated with fewer adverse events, including arrhythmia, compared to dopamine. Phenylephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin should not be used as first-line therapy. Vasopressin is employed after high-dose conventional vasopressors have failed. The use of low-dose dopamine is no longer recommended based on a clinical trial showing no benefit in critically ill patients at risk for renal failure. If an agent is needed to increase cardiac output, dobutamine is the agent of choice.
