Calcaneal apophysitis

Calcaneal apophysitis, also known as Sever disease, is the most common etiology of heel pain in children,
usually occurring between 5 and 11 years of age. It is thought that in these children the bones grow faster
than the muscles and tendons. A tight Achilles tendon then pulls on its insertion site at the posterior
calcaneus with repetitive running or jumping activities, causing microtrauma to the area. There may be
swelling and tenderness in this area and passive dorsiflexion may increase the pain. Radiography is usually
normal and therefore does not often aid in the diagnosis, but it may reveal a fragmented or sclerotic
calcaneal apophysis. Treatment involves decreasing pain-inducing activities, anti-inflammatory or analgesic
medication if needed, ice, stretching and strengthening of the gastrocnemius-soleus complex, and the use
of orthotic devices.

Plantar fasciitis and heel pad syndrome cause pain on the plantar surface of the heel rather than posteriorly.
Achilles tendinopathy causes tenderness to palpation of the Achilles tendon. Tarsal tunnel syndrome related
to compression of the posterior tibial nerve causes neuropathic pain and numbness in the posteromedial
ankle and heel.
