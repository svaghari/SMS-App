NSAIDs

The first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhea should be NSAIDs (SOR A). They should be started
at the onset of menses and continued for the first 1â€“2 days of the menstrual cycle. Combined oral
contraceptives may be effective for primary dysmenorrhea, but there is a lack of high-quality randomized,
controlled trials demonstrating pain improvement (SOR B). They may be a good choice if the patient also
desires contraception. Although combined oral contraceptives and intramuscular and subcutaneous
progestin-only contraceptives are effective treatments for dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis, they are
not first-line therapy for primary dysmenorrhea.
