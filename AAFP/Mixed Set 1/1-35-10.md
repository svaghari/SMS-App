Cirrhosis with ascites

Evaluation of the pleural fluid is important to assist in determining the cause of the effusion. Protein, glucose, LDH, and cell counts should be measured in the pleural fluid. This can help determine if the effusion is exudative or transudative. A pleural protein to serum protein ratio >0.5 or a pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH ratio >0.6 suggests an exudative effusion. Lower ratios suggest a transudative process. With transudates, the pleural fluid pH is typically between 7.40 and 7.55, with fewer than 1000 WBCs, and the glucose level is similar to the serum glucose level. Cirrhosis with ascites is a cause of transudative effusion. Pleural effusions associated with malignancy, pneumonia, viral illness, and asbestosis tend to be exudative.
