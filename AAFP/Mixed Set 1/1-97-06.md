No cancer screening

The Society of General Internal Medicine does not recommend cancer screening in adults with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. Other organizations have similar recommendations for specific cancers, usually based on a life expectancy of less than 10 years or an age greater than 65. For patients who have had negative screening results for cervical cancer in the past, this screening may be stopped at age 65. For patients who are 76–85 years of age, screening for colorectal cancer and breast cancer should be performed on an individual basis, taking into account the patient’s overall health and screening history.
