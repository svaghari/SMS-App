Prazosin (Minipress)

Prazosin is an Î±-adrenergic receptor antagonist and is recommended for the treatment of nightmares in posttraumatic stress disorder (SOR A). It is thought to reduce sympathetic outflow in the brain. Although clonidine may be tried, evidence of its effectiveness is sparse (SOR C). Clonazepam, propranolol, and divalproex have not been recommended.
