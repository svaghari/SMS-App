Supportive care only

The defining symptom of acute bronchitis is cough. Even in smokers the etiologic agent is viral at least 90% of the time, so antibiotics are not indicated. Unless wheezing is noted, albuterol is not helpful. Inhaled corticosteroids are used in maintenance therapy for asthma. Indications for an adult patient with acute bronchitis to have a chest radiograph include: bloody sputum, rusty-colored sputum, or dyspnea; a pulse rate >100 beats/min; a respiratory rate >24/min; or a temperature >37.8°C (100.0°F). A chest radiograph is also indicated if there are abnormal findings on a chest examination such as fremitus, egophony, or focal consolidation. Supportive care is made easier by informing the patient that symptoms are likely to last 2–3 weeks. Symptoms may be managed with measures such as dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, or honey.
