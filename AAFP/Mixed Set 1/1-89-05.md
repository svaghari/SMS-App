Easy bruising

Easy bruising, moon facies, buffalo hump, abdominal striae, hypertension, and proximal myopathy suggest Cushingâ€™s syndrome. Because this syndrome is very rare compared to polycystic ovarian syndrome, routine screening is not indicated in women with hypoandrogenic anovulation. Acne, hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, and acanthosis nigricans are all consistent with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Ref: ACOG Practice Bulletin.
