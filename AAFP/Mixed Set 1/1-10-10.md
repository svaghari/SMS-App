A Cobb angle of 20°

There are three major risk factors for curve progression of idiopathic scoliosis: the magnitude of the curve at presentation, the potential for future growth, and female sex. Of these factors, curve progression has the most impact on the need for referral versus observation. The Cobb angle is based on spine radiology that quantifies the magnitude of the scoliosis curve. If the Cobb angle is 20° there is a high risk that the curve will progress and that the patient may need treatment. Age, sex, menstrual status, pubertal status, and growth potential are less important factors. Scoliosis typically does not cause pain and it is more likely that this patient’s weight is contributing to her back pain.
