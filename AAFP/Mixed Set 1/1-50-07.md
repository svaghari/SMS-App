Methotrexate (Trexall)

The American College of Rheumatology recommends methotrexate, a nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), as a first-line agent in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the absence of contraindications, such as underlying liver disease. Starting DMARDs within 3 months of the onset of rheumatoid arthritis symptoms is more likely to result in sustained remissions. The addition of short-term prednisone is indicated in select cases when disease activity is high. The use of biological agents such as adalimumab, etanercept, and others is indicated only in refractory cases and in patients who cannot tolerate nonbiologic DMARDs.
