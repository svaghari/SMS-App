Men who have sex with men

Factors associated with increased prevalence rates for syphilis in the United States include a history of incarceration or commercial sex work, living in the southern or western United States, residing in a major metropolitan area, African-American ethnicity, and being a male younger than 29 years of age. The risk for syphilis infection is highest among men who have sex with men and among persons who are HIV-positive.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and adolescents who are at increased risk be screened for syphilis infection (A recommendation). The USPSTF also recommends that local community and socioeconomic factors be considered when identifying patients at increased risk for infection who should be screened.
