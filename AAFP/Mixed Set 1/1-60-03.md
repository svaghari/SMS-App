180 mg/dL

Insulin therapy should be initiated in hospitalized patients with persistent hyperglycemia, starting at a threshold of 180 mg/dL. Once insulin therapy is started, a target glucose range of 140–180 mg/dL is recommended for the majority of hospitalized patients, regardless of whether they have a critical illness.
