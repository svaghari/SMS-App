Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)

This case is typical for acute parotitis, which is commonly caused by dehydration and can be diagnosed
from the history and examination. Empiric treatment is directed toward gram-positive and anaerobic
organisms, with the most common pathogen being Staphylococcus. These are often penicillin resistant so
a Î²-lactamase inhibitor is the agent of choice. Treatment should be followed up with cultures.
Administration of sialagogues such as lemon drops may be helpful, as well as parotid gland massage.

CT or MRI may help confirm the diagnosis but imaging is usually not necessary. The history and clinical
examination are most important for making the diagnosis. Incision and drainage would be appropriate only
for an abscess, and surgical removal of the parotid gland is not indicated.
