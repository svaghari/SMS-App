Diabetes mellitus

The patient has Dupuytren’s disease, which is most common in men over 40 years of age.  It is a progressive condition that causes the fibrous fascia of the palmar surface to shorten and thicken.  It initially can be managed with observation, but corticosteroid injection and surgery may be needed.  The condition will regress in 10% of patients.  There is a 3%-33% prevalence of Dupuytren’s contracture in patients with diabetes mellitus; however, these patients tend to have a mild form of the disease with slow progression.
