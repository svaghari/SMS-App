Aripiprazole (Abilify)

Although the FDA has not approved the use of antipsychotics for aggressive behavior associated with dementia, they are often used to treat refractory behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Their off-label use should be considered only when nonpharmacologic therapies are ineffective and the behaviors pose a risk of harm to the patient or others (SOR C), and the drug should be discontinued if there is no evidence of symptom improvement (SOR A). In a meta-analysis of three atypical antipsychotics, only aripiprazole showed small average reductions in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Olanzapine has demonstrated inconsistent results and ziprasidone is ineffective. Diphenhydramine is an anticholinergic agent and could exacerbate behaviors. Mirtazapine is indicated for depression. The American Geriatrics Society recommends against the use of benzodiazepines in older adults as a first choice for insomnia, agitation, or delirium.
