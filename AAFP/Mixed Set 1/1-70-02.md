A positive response to levodopa

Patients with Parkinson's disease should respond to an adequate therapeutic challenge of levodopa or a dopamine agonist. The diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease is clinical, not radiographic. Cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease include an asymmetric tremor onset and a distal resting tremor of 3â€“6 Hz.
