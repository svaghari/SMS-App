Reduced FEV1 and a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio

Asthma is typically associated with an obstructive impairment that is reversible with short-acting bronchodilators. A reduced FEV1 and a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio indicates airflow obstruction. A reduced FVC with a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio is consistent with a restrictive pattern of lung function.
