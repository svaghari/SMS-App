A spot urine protein/creatinine ratio

Individuals with nephrotic syndrome often present with edema and fatigue with no evidence of severe liver
disease or heart failure. Hallmarks of this problem include heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and
peripheral edema, often with hyperlipidemia as well. While most of these cases are idiopathic, secondary
causes such as diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, and medication reactions should be
considered.
To confirm proteinuria in the nephrotic range a spot urine protein/creatinine ratio is now suggested instead
of a 24-hour collection of urine. Checking urine for eosinophils has been recommended in the past for
evaluation for acute interstitial nephritis but subsequent studies have shown a lack of specificity and
sensitivity. Renal ultrasonography would be indicated if the glomerular filtration rate were reduced.
Echocardiography would be appropriate if heart failure were suspected. While a renal biopsy is often
recommended, it is most useful in patients with suspected underlying systemic lupus erythematosus or
similar disorders when a biopsy can guide management decisions and prognosis.
