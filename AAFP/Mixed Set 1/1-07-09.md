Donepezil (Aricept)

The 2015 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults ï‚³65 years of age states that donepezil use should be avoided in patients with syncope, due to an increased risk of bradycardia (Moderate Evidence Level; Strong Strength of Recommendation). Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor. Due to their cholinergic effect, these medications have a vagotonic effect on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This can cause bradycardia or heart block in patients with or without underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncope has been reported with these medications.

Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and is not associated with bradycardia. Escitalopram, lisinopril, and zolpidem are also not associated with bradycardia.
