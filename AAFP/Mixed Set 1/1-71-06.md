Ask the patient to designate someone with whom you can discuss the results and prognosis

In a patient-centered approach to communication regarding end-of-life care, a patient’s wishes to not know about a diagnosis or prognosis should be respected. However, it is reasonable to ask the patient to name a proxy with whom you may discuss the issues. The other options listed do not respect the patient’s desire to not know her diagnosis or prognosis.
