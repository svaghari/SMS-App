Obtain a troponin I measurement and an EKG

This patient has symptoms that suggest acute coronary syndrome, which includes chest pain with activity that radiates to the shoulder. An EKG is essential early in the evaluation of a patient with chest pain, and the initial evaluation should also include a troponin I measurement. The patient should neither be admitted nor given a benzodiazepine until the EKG is performed. The diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome should be established prior to heart catheterization. Other laboratory tests may be appropriate, but they are not the most important initial tests.
