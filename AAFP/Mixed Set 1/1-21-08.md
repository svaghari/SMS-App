Trichomoniasis

Trichomoniasis classically presents as a greenish-yellow, frothy discharge with a foul odor. Erythema and
inflammation of the vagina and cervix are often present and can include punctate hemorrhages (strawberry
cervix). Atrophic vaginitis may cause a thin, clear discharge and is usually associated with a thin, friable
vaginal mucosa. Irritant/allergic vaginitis causes burning and soreness with vulvar erythema but usually
does not cause any significant discharge. Bacterial vaginosis more commonly presents as a thin,
homogenous discharge with a fishy odor and no cervical or vaginal inflammation. Vulvovaginal candidiasis
presents with white, thick, cheesy, or curdy discharge.
