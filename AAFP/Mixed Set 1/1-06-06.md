A short course of azithromycin (Zithromax) if she develops diarrhea

Traveler’s diarrhea is the most common infection in international travelers. A short course of antibiotics
can be taken after a traveler develops diarrhea and usually shortens the duration of symptoms (SOR A).
Azithromycin is preferred to treat severe traveler’s diarrhea. Rifaximin or fluoroquinolones may be used
to treat severe nondysenteric traveler’s diarrhea. Prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely recommended.
For patients at high risk, bismuth subsalicylate reduces the risk but does not need to be initiated prior to
travel. There is insufficient evidence for the use of probiotics to prevent traveler’s diarrhea. Loperamide
can be used with or without antibiotics after symptoms develop but is not recommended for prophylaxis.
