Ipratropium (Atrovent) nasal spray

Ipratropium is the only nasally inhaled anticholinergic recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians for a cough caused by the common cold. One study showed that the nasal formulation decreases rhinorrhea and sneezing, and a Cochrane review found that ipratropium bromide nasal spray improved rhinorrhea but did not help nasal stuffiness (SOR B). Antihistamine monotherapy (either sedating or nonsedating) such as diphenhydramine was no more effective than placebo (SOR A). Corticosteroids have not been found to be effective for the symptoms of a common cold. Intranasal zinc should not be used because it may result in the permanent loss of smell.
