Femoropopliteal bypass

When deciding whether or not to recommend preoperative noninvasive cardiac testing, both patient risk factors and surgical risk factors should be taken into account. Surgical procedures associated with a high (>5%) risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia include aortic and peripheral vascular surgery and emergent major operations, especially in patients over 75 years of age. Head and neck surgery, intraperitoneal and intrathoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and prostate surgery carry an intermediate risk (1%â€“5%). Endoscopic procedures and cataract and breast surgeries are considered low-risk (<1%) procedures.
