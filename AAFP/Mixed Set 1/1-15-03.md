Renal ultrasonography

Renal parenchymal diseases such as glomerulonephritis, congenital abnormalities, and reflux nephropathy
are the most common cause of hypertension in preadolescent children. Preadolescent children with
hypertension should be evaluated for possible secondary causes and renal ultrasonography should be the
first choice of imaging in this age group.
Renin and aldosterone levels are indicated if there is a reason to suspect primary hyperaldosteronism, such
as unexplained hypokalemia. Measurement of 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines and
normetanephrines is used to diagnose pheochromocytomas, which are rare and usually present with a triad
of symptoms including headache, palpitations, and sweating. Doppler ultrasonography of the renal arteries
is useful for diagnosing renal artery stenosis, which should be suspected in patients with coronary or
peripheral atherosclerosis or young adults, especially women 19â€“39 years of age, who are more at risk for
renal artery stenosis due to fibromuscular dysplasia. Sleep studies are indicated in patients who are obese
or have signs or symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea.
