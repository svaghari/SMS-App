A biopsy of the colon

Microscopic colitis is characterized by intermittent secretory diarrhea in older patients, although all ages can be affected. The cause is unknown, but there is some evidence that more than 6 months of NSAID use increases the risk. Only a biopsy from the transverse colon can confirm the diagnosis. Two histologic patterns are found: lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis. The other diagnostic studies listed do not confirm the diagnosis.
