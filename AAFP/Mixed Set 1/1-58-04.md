Low-dose aspirin therapy is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients 50–59 years of age who have a risk of CVD 10% (USPSTF B recommendation). The recommendation statement adds that the patient should have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, should be willing to take daily aspirin for at least 10 years, and should not be at increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. The decision to start aspirin therapy for patients 60–69 years of age should be based on individual considerations (USPSTF C recommendation). For adults younger than 50 or age 70 or older, the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms (C recommendation). The recent Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial indicated that daily aspirin use in those over age 70 did not significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, and did not increase disability-free survival.
