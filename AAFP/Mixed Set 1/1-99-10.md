Calcium gluconate

During the treatment of severe preeclampsia with intravenous magnesium, the occurrence of apnea and areflexia is most consistent with magnesium toxicity. In addition to hemodynamic support, calcium infusion is recommended as an antidote. Calcium chloride can be used if a central line has been established. Calcium gluconate would be safer with a peripheral intravenous site.
Lorazepam, phenytoin, and fosphenytoin are less useful in preventing eclamptic seizures than magnesium. Labetalol is not indicated given the patient’s current blood pressure level. Dopamine, a pressor agent, is not indicated in this scenario, and could aggravate the patient’s preeclampsia.
