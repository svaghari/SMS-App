Repeat pelvic ultrasonography in 8–10 weeks

Functional ovarian cysts are estimated to be present in approximately 15% of menstruating women and are often found incidentally on a pelvic examination or on diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons. The majority of these lesions resolve spontaneously within two or three menstrual cycles and management should consist of follow-up ultrasonography 8–12 weeks after the cyst is identified. Cysts that are particularly symptomatic, have less than simple features, are >10 cm in size, or that persist longer than 12 weeks should be referred for consideration of diagnostic removal (cystectomy or oophorectomy depending on patient characteristics). Patients who carry a BRCA gene or who have a family history of ovarian cancer should also be considered for invasive testing sooner. Serum CA-125 testing is difficult to interpret in premenopausal patients, who frequently have elevated levels without evidence of a malignancy. In postmenopausal women with an ovarian cyst a CA-125 level >35 U/mL should prompt referral for removal.
