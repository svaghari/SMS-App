Avoiding dietary restrictions

Effective interventions for weight loss in nursing home patients include providing meals in a pleasant,
home-like environment. Avoiding dietary restrictions has low quality evidence of effectiveness. There is
high quality evidence that initiating tube feedings in patients with severe dementia is not only ineffective
but may lead to problems such as decubitus ulcers and aspiration. There is low to very low evidence of
the effectiveness for prescribing appetite stimulants, selenium, vitamin B, or vitamin D supplements unless
there is a documented deficiency. Neither quality of life nor survival is improved.
