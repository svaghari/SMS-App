Half-strength apple juice and food on demand

Family physicians often see patients with diarrheal illnesses and most of these are viral. Patients sometimes have misconceptions about preferred fluid and feeding recommendations during these illnesses. The World Health Organization recommends oral rehydration with low osmolarity drinks (oral rehydration solution) and early refeeding. Half-strength apple juice has been shown to be effective, and it approximates an oral rehydration solution. Its use prevents patient measurement errors and the purchase of beverages with an inappropriate osmolarity. Low osmolarity solutions contain glucose and water, which decrease stool frequency, emesis, and the need for intravenous fluids compared to higher osmolarity solutions like soda and most sports drinks. Water increases the risk of hyponatremia in children. This patient is not ill enough to need intravenous fluids. Early refeeding has been shown to decrease the duration of illness.
