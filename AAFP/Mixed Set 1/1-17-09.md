The subacromial space

Injection of glucocorticoids (usually mixed with a local anesthetic) into the subacromial space may be
considered in patients with rotator cuff tendinitis if the pain is significant enough to interfere with sleep
and/or function despite adequate analgesia.
An intra-articular injection is appropriate for a patient with severe shoulder osteoarthritis. A corticosteroid
injection into the biceps or deltoid insertions is not appropriate. An acromioclavicular injection is
appropriate for acromioclavicular arthritis but not for rotator cuff tendinitis.
