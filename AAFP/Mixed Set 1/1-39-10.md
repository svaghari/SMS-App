Oral dexamethasone

A single dose of oral dexamethasone improves symptoms in children with mild croup when compared with placebo. It is as effective for reducing croup symptoms as nebulized budesonide and is less distressing for the child. There is currently no evidence from randomized, controlled trials to support the use of humidification or a helium-oxygen mixture to reduce the symptoms of croup.
