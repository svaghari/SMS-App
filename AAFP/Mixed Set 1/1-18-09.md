Bariatric surgery

This patient presents with morbid obesity complicated by several obesity-related conditions. Bariatric
surgery has been shown to result in greater weight loss compared to nonsurgical interventions (SOR A).
It has also been shown to be highly effective in treating obesity-related comorbid conditions such as
diabetes mellitus (SOR A). Patients with a BMI ï‚³40 kg/m2 should be referred for consideration of bariatric
surgery (SOR B). While worksite intervention, exercise therapy, behavioral therapy, and pharmacotherapy
are appropriate treatments for obesity, these interventions are all less effective than bariatric surgery.
