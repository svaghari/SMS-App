Rifampin, 600 mg every 12 hours for 2 days

Health-care workers exposed to a patient with meningococcal meningitis are at increased risk of developing systemic disease and should receive chemoprophylaxis, especially if the contact is intimate.  Secondary cases usually occur within 4 days of the initial case.  Therefore, prophylactic treatment should begin as soon as possible.  Rifampin has been shown to be 90% effective in eliminating meningococcus from the nasopharynx.  Other appropriate chemoprophylactic agents include minocycline and ciprofloxacin. Even high doses of penicillin may not eradicate nasopharyngeal meningococci.  Prednisone has no place in chemoprophylaxis.  Meningococcal vaccine appears to have clinical efficacy, but it usually takes more than 5 days to become effective. Ref: Goldman L, Ausiello D (eds): Cecil Medicine, ed 23.
