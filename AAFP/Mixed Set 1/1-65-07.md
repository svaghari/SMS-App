When being treated for a potentially fatal illness

Patients often welcome spiritual discussion, depending on the situation. The percentage that welcome this discussion increases with the severity of illness, and is greatest among those who are very seriously ill with a potentially fatal disease. Spiritual inquiry during medical care should focus on understanding, compassion, and hope, and should be directed toward individuals who suffer from serious illness.
