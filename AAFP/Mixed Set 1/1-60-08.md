Primary hyperparathyroidism

The most common cause of hypercalcemia is hyperparathyroidism. This is seldom symptomatic and is often discovered through routine blood testing. Hypercalcemia due to cancer can be caused by secretion of the parathyroid hormoneâ€“related protein and by osteoclastic bone resorption. Other causes of hypercalcemia include thiazide diuretics, lithium, vitamin D intoxication, hyperthyroidism, milk alkali syndrome from excessive calcium antacid ingestion, adrenal insufficiency, and lymphoma.
