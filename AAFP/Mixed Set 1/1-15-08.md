Atrial fibrillation refractory to medical therapy

Atrial ventricular nodal ablation is recommended for patients whose atrial fibrillation is refractory to
medical therapy, and requires that patients be anticoagulated for at least 1 month prior to the procedure
and for several months afterward (SOR C). Patients with atrial fibrillation who are hemodynamically
unstable should be considered for emergent cardioversion (SOR C). Atrial ventricular nodal ablation is not
necessary for patients successfully converted to sinus rhythm or for those who are successfully treated with
medical interventions for rate control and anticoagulation.
