respiratory rate

There are several decision support tools to assist in predicting 30-day mortality for patients with
community-acquired pneumonia. Calculating the number of high-risk markers can aid in deciding whether
to admit the patient to the hospital. The risk of mortality increases with a respiratory rate 30/min,
hypotension, confusion or disorientation, a BUN level 20 mg/dL, age >65 years, male sex, or the
presence of heart failure or COPD.
