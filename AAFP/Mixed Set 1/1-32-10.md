Interstitial lung disease

Patients with systemic sclerosis (SS) in its final stages often develop a restrictive lung disease (SOR C). Interstitial lung disease and pulmonary artery hypertension are common. While the restrictive pattern is similar to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, this condition is characteristic of SS and is not idiopathic. Emphysema presents with an obstructive pattern on pulmonary function tests. Pulmonary edema can develop from cardiac malfunction and heart failure, but it is not present in this patient. Sarcoidosis is not related to SS. There is a 10-year mortality of 42% in patients with SS who have an FVC <50%. Cyclophosphamide may be helpful in some cases to improve lung function, decrease dyspnea, and improve the patientâ€™s quality of life (SOR B).
