Surgical referral

This patient has a Jones fracture. The treatment plan for this type of fracture needs to account for the activity level of the patient. It has been shown that active patients have shorter healing times and return to activity sooner with surgical management. A competitive dancer would be best managed with surgery. If the nonsurgical option is chosen the patient is given an initial posterior splint and followed up in 3–5 days, then placed in a short non–weight-bearing cast for 6 weeks, at which time a repeat radiograph is taken. If the radiograph shows healing, the patient can return to gradual weight bearing. If the radiograph does not show proper healing, then the period of non–weight bearing is extended.
