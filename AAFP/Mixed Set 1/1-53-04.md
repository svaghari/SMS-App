Screening for posttraumatic stress disorder

A full history and physical examination are indicated for all refugees within 30 days of arrival in the United States, with a professional medical interpreter if needed (SOR C). In addition to addressing medical needs, the focus should be on emotional support and barriers to health care access (SOR C). All refugees should be screened for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (SOR C). They should also be screened for anemia, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, nutritional deficiencies, tuberculosis, and COPD (SOR C). If there is no vaccination documentation, routine vaccines should be provided except for varicella and hepatitis B. Serology should be performed before these vaccines are administered (SOR C).
