Referral to a urologist

Patients with a history of cryptorchidism are at high risk for the development of testicular cancer, especially if orchiopexy is performed after puberty. If sonography shows a hypoechoic mass, a testicular biopsy is contraindicated, since it may contaminate the scrotum or alter the lymphatic drainage. Radical inguinal orchiectomy is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Watchful waiting would not be an option in this high-risk patient. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and measurement of the tumor markers are useful for staging and as an indication of tumor burden, but they are not diagnostic.
