Extinction of this habit by age 3

Head banging has been estimated to be present in 3%–15% of normal children and usually begins between the ages of 5 and 11 months. The vast majority of these children will engage in this activity for only a few months, and most will stop by age 3. Rarely does the behavior cause lacerations or skull fractures, and the presence of either should prompt the physician to consider the possibility of another cause such as abuse. The incidence of head banging is higher in children with developmental disorders such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Down syndrome, or autism. However, this child has no sign of any such disorder and has normal developmental milestones. Ref: Vinson RP, Gelinas-Sovell DF: Head banging in young children.
