A repeat TB skin test 2 months after she returns

Individuals who travel internationally to areas with a high prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) are at risk for
contracting the disease if they have prolonged exposure to individuals with TB, such as working in a health
care setting. The CDC recommends either a TB skin test or an interferon-gamma release assay prior to
leaving the United States. If the test is negative, the individual should repeat the testing 8â€“10 weeks after
returning. A chest radiograph in asymptomatic individuals or prophylactic treatment at any point is not
recommended. Isoniazid and rifampin are options for treatment of latent TB.
