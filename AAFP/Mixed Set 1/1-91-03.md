Free water restriction

This patient probably has the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). SIADH can be caused by CNS tumors, various infections such as meningitis, and pneumonia. Several drugs can cause this condition, including amiodarone, carbamazepine, SSRIs, and chlorpromazine. In this fairly asymptomatic patient, initial management should be free water restriction. As she is hemodynamically stable, she does not need normal saline. Moreover, administration of normal saline may exacerbate the hyponatremia, as the sodium may be rapidly excreted while the water is retained. If she had a rapid onset and neurologic symptoms such as seizures, hypertonic saline could be given. Correction should be slow, with a goal of no more than a 1-2 mmol/L/hr increase in the sodium level; a normal sodium level should not be reached within the first 48 hours of treatment. Demeclocycline is appropriate for patients who cannot adhere to the requirement for fluid restriction, or who have recalcitrant hyponatremia despite restriction.
