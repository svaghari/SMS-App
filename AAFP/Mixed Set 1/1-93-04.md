Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome)

DRESS is an acronym for Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms. The hallmark of DRESS syndrome is erythroderma accompanied by fever, lymphadenopathy, elevation of liver enzymes, and eosinophilia. The offending medication should be discontinued immediately and treatment with corticosteroids should be initiated. Seizure medications such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital are responsible for approximately one-third of cases. Allopurinol-associated DRESS syndrome has the highest mortality rate.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome is characterized by a vesiculobullous rash with mucocutaneous involvement, and erysipelas is a painful localized rash with well-demarcated borders. Red man syndrome is associated with vancomycin.
