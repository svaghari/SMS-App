Informed consent to treat is considered an important ethical and legal part of caring for children and adolescents. Some situations can become confusing when trying to balance the need for treatment, a child’s consent, and a parent or guardian’s permission. In most states, 18 is the age when legal decisions can be made; however, in some states 21 years old is the age of legal consent.

Children below the age of majority must have proof of permission to treat from a parent or guardian for non-emergent care. This does not apply to emergency situations in which a delay in care could result in serious harm. Another exception to parental consent is when a child is considered emancipated under state law. This can happen with a court order, or (in some states) if the child is married, is a parent, is in the military, or is living independently. Either biologic parent can consent to treatment unless one of them is explicitly denied guardianship. If a child presents with a non-emergent condition and does not have evidence of permission from a parent or guardian, permission should be sought before the physician interaction takes place.
