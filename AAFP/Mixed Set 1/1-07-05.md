The Lachman test

The Lachman test is the most accurate test for an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear (SOR A). Accurate testing can lead to appropriate referral and treatment for ACL tears, and early detection can lead to better outcomes. The Lachman test has higher validity based on a sensitivity of 68% for partial ruptures and 96% for complete ruptures. The other two commonly used tests are the anterior drawer test, which has a sensitivity of 38% and a specificity of 81%, and the pivot shift test, which is more technically difficult than the other two tests and has a sensitivity ranging from 24% to 85%. The pivot shift test is effective if done correctly but should not be used alone to diagnose an ACL tear (SOR A).

The lever sign test is a newer test that holds promise for detecting ACL tears and is easily performed in the office. However, sensitivity and specificity reports vary (SOR B). The McMurray test is used to detect meniscal tears.
