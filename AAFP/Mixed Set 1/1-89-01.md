Subcutaneous or intranasal calcitonin (Calcimar, Miacalcin) may be very helpful for pain relief

The patient described has a classic presentation of an osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. The diagnosis should be confirmed with a plain radiograph. Treatment is basically symptomatic, with a period of bed rest as short as possible (to avoid complications of immobility), pain medication, and bracing. Salmon calcitonin (injectable or intranasal) is often helpful in providing pain relief. Long-term management of underlying osteoporosis may help prevent future fractures.
