Obesity

Because debilitating knee osteoarthritis is a frequent health concern in older adults, physicians should try to identify and possibly modify factors that increase the risk for this condition. Pooled data from many large studies has been sufficient to clearly identify several major risk factors for the development and progression of osteoarthritis of the knees. Overweight and obesity have consistently been found to approximately double the risk for developing knee osteoarthritis. Other factors that have been identified as risk factors include female sex, advancing age (50–75 years of age), and previous trauma. Smoking, inactivity, moderate physical activity, and socioeconomic status have not been shown to affect one’s risk for developing knee osteoarthritis. However, any of these factors in the extreme may be detrimental to joint health in general.
