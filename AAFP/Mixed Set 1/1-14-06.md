Atorvastatin (Lipitor)

Statins such as atorvastatin, antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin, angiotensin inhibitors such as lisinopril, and β-blockers such as metoprolol have all been shown to increase survival after an acute coronary artery event. Calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, fibrates such as gemfibrozil, and nitroglycerins such as isosorbide mononitrate have not been shown to increase survival. Spironolactone has been shown to increase survival in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fractions but not in those with ischemic heart disease with preserved ejection fractions.
