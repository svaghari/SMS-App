Ibuprofen

NSAIDs such as ibuprofen are thought to increase the risk of anastomotic ulcerations or perforations in patients who have had bariatric surgery and should be completely avoided after such surgery if possible (C Recommendation, Level of evidence 3). It is also recommended that alternative pain medications that can be used are identified prior to the surgery (D Recommendation). Options such as acetaminophen, gabapentin, hydrocodone, and tramadol can be considered in patients who have had bariatric surgery if the medications are clinically appropriate otherwise.
