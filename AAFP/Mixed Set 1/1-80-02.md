Albuterol

Severe hyperkalemia (>7.0 mEq/L) requires aggressive treatment.  Calcium chloride or gluconate has no effect on the plasma potassium level, but it should be given first, as it rapidly stabilizes the membranes of cardiac myocytes, reducing the risk of cardiac dysrhythmias.  Therapies that translocate potassium from the serum to the intracellular space should be instituted next, as they can quickly (albeit temporarily) lower the plasma concentration of potassium.  These interventions include sodium bicarbonate, glucose with insulin, and albuterol.  Total body potassium can be lowered with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, but this takes longer to affect the plasma potassium level than translocation methods.  In the most severe cases, acute hemodialysis can be instituted. Ref: Sood MM, Sood AR, Richardson R: Emergency management and commonly encountered outpatient scenarios in patients with hyperkalemia.
