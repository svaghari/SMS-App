Unilateral symptoms

Hearing loss and tinnitus are both common and typically benign complaints in primary care. If both are
present in only one ear, the diagnosis of acoustic neuroma, also known as vestibular schwannoma, should
be considered. Acoustic neuroma is a slow-growing benign tumor of the Schwann cells surrounding the
vestibular cochlear (8th cranial) nerve. Hearing loss associated with acoustic neuroma is typically slow in
onset. The presence of vertigo on the affected side is another symptom of abnormal function of the
vestibular cochlear nerve and should further raise suspicion of acoustic neuroma or another process
affecting that nerve. MRI is the preferred imaging study for diagnosing acoustic neuroma (SOR A).
Bilateral hearing loss is more common and is less likely to be caused by an intracranial mass. Exposure
to loud sounds can cause hearing loss unrelated to an intracranial mass. Pain and otorrhea suggest infection
rather than an intracranial tumor.
