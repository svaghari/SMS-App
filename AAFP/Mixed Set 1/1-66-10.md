Observation

Uterine fibroid tumors (leiomyomas) are the most common female reproductive tract tumors, with some evidence suggesting that the cumulative incidence in women ages 25â€“45 is approximately 30%. Symptoms related to fibroids can include menorrhagia, pelvic pain, obstructive symptoms, infertility, or pregnancy loss. However, many fibroids are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally, with expectant management being the treatment of choice in this situation (SOR B). The risk of malignant leiomyosarcoma is exceedingly small (0.23% in one study) and there is a risk of side effects or complications from other treatment modalities.
For women who are symptomatic, the data is insufficient to allow conclusions to be made about the most appropriate therapy. Surgical options include myomectomy, hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization, and myolysis, but data to allow direct comparison is lacking. With the exception of trials of GnRH-agonist therapy as an adjunct to surgery, there is not enough randomized trial data to support the use of medical therapies (oral contraceptives, NSAIDs, progestins) in the treatment of women with symptomatic fibroids.
