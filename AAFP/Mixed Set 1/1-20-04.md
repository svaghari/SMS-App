Placement of a levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena)

Polycystic ovary syndrome can significantly affect multiple organ systems, and menstrual irregularities
from anovulatory cycles are very common. Treatment should be based on the patientâ€™s goals and modified
based on her desire for fertility. In a patient who is not interested in near-term fertility and whose goal is
to control menstrual irregularities, a levonorgestrel IUD is most likely to reduce the frequency, duration,
and volume of bleeding. Metformin is used to treat insulin resistance, dietary modifications are used to
treat obesity, spironolactone can be used to treat hirsutism or acne, and clomiphene is used to induce
ovulation and fertility.
