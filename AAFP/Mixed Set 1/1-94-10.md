Migraine headaches with aura

The U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use were created to guide health care providers in assessing the safety of contraceptive use for patients with specific conditions. Category 1 includes conditions for which no restrictions exist for use of the contraceptive method. Category 2 indicates that the method generally can be used, but careful follow-up may be required. Category 3 is used to classify conditions for which the method usually is not recommended unless more-preferred methods are not available or acceptable. Category 4 comprises conditions that represent an unacceptable health risk if the method is used. For combined hormonal contraceptives, migraine headaches with aura at any age are classified as category 4 because of the increased risk of ischemic stroke.
