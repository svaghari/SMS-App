Conservative management with ice, compression wraps, and activity modification

Conservative treatment is the recommended initial management for olecranon bursitis when there is no history of trauma or signs of septic bursitis. Aspiration of the bursal fluid is not recommended initially due to the risk of iatrogenic infection, but can be considered for symptomatic relief if there is significant enlargement or symptoms, or for diagnosis and culture if septic bursitis is suspected. Antibiotics are not recommended for aseptic bursitis and should be delayed in septic bursitis until after aspiration for culture. MRSA coverage may be indicated if the patient is at high risk for MRSA infection. An intrabursal corticosteroid injection is not routinely recommended for bursitis unless an underlying inflammatory condition is suspected, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. An intrabursal hyaluronic acid injection is not a recommended treatment for bursitis.
