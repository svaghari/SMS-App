Evidence from randomized, placebo-controlled studies

Randomized, controlled studies yield stronger evidence than other types of studies, especially case-control or cohort studies, because randomization provides the greatest safeguard against unanticipated study bias. Evidence obtained from randomized, controlled studies is considered level 1 (strongest) by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Evidence obtained from nonrandomized, controlled studies is considered level 2a, well-designed case-control and cohort studies are considered level 2b, and reports of expert committees or respected authorities are considered level 3 (weakest).
