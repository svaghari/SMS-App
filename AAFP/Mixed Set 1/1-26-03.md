Karyotyping

Brain MRI would be useful in ruling out brain and pituitary tumors, but this patient has no brain tumor symptoms and normal prolactin and TSH levels. A trial of combined oral contraceptive pills may precipitate withdrawal bleeding, but this has poor sensitivity as a marker of ovarian function (SOR C) and will not lead to a diagnosis.

There are no signs or symptoms of hyperandrogenism, so a serum testosterone level would not be helpful. Pelvic ultrasonography to confirm the presence of a uterus is not indicated by the physical findings at this point.

Short stature and the lack of pubertal changes are characteristics of primary ovarian failure and Turner syndrome. A karyotype to rule out Turner syndrome and the presence of Y chromosome material is indicated at this point.
