vancomycin

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the predominant cause of suppurative skin and
soft-tissue infection. While community-acquired strains have been susceptible to many antibiotics,
clindamycin is associated with Clostridium difficile enterocolitis, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is usually
used orally only for outpatient treatment, and doxycycline and minocycline are often effective clinically
but seldom used for serious infections. Resistance to quinolones is increasing and may emerge during
treatment. Vancomycin given parenterally is generally still the drug of choice for hospitalized patients.
