Fat-pad atrophy

Fat-pad atrophy is a common cause of heel pain in the geriatric patient, and in contrast to plantar fasciitis, causes pain as the day progresses. Plantar fasciitis classically presents as morning pain. Tarsal tunnel syndrome causes neuropathic pain in the distribution of the posterior tibial nerve, radiating into the plantar aspect of the foot toward the toes. Lumbar radiculopathy involves pain radiating down the leg into the heel, and is usually associated with weakness of dorsiflexion of the big toe and a decreased ankle reflex. Multiple myeloma would be an extremely unusual cause of heel pain; heel pain associated with cancer more commonly presents nocturnally. Ref: Buchbinder R: Plantar fasciitis.
