a set schedule for urination

There are four types of urinary incontinence in women: functional incontinence, which occurs when the patient's inability to ambulate or transfer results in loss of urine; urinary stress incontinence, which is a result of pelvic relaxation and is manifested as involuntary loss of urine with increases in abdominal pressure such as that which occurs with laughing, sneezing, or coughing; detrusor instability or overactive bladder, which is when the urge to urinate is quickly followed by loss of urine, usually a large volume; and neurogenic bladder, which is marked by constant leakage of small amounts of urine.
Neurogenic bladder can be caused by diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury, and is  usually initially treated with a strict voluntary urination schedule, which may be coupled with Crede's maneuver. It can be treated further by adding bethanechol to the regimen. Many patients have to be taught intermittent self-catheterization of the bladder. Ultimately, the patient may require resection of the internal sphincter of the bladder neck.
