Gastroesophageal reflux

Gastroesophageal reflux accounts for a significant number of cases of failure to thrive, crib death, and recurrent pneumonia. Features of gastroesophageal reflux include a history of recurrent pneumonia, a low growth curve, a family history of sudden infant death syndrome, and normocytic anemia. A sweat chloride level of 20 mEq/L rules out cystic fibrosis. Normal serum calcium excludes DiGeorge’s syndrome. The battered child generally presents with more than just a single recurring medical problem. β-Thalassemia would be indicated by a microcytic anemia.
