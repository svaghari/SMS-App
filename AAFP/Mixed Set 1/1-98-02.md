Ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% (Ciprodex) topically

Acute otitis externa is treated with topical antibiotics. Although no preparation has been shown to be most effective, a fluoroquinolone does not create a risk of ototoxicity if the tympanic membrane is not intact. Topical corticosteroids may hasten symptom reduction. Oral antibiotics are not appropriate unless the infection has spread beyond the ear canal, or if the patient has diabetes mellitus or is immunocompromised.
