he will begin to grow taller within a year or so

Constitutional growth delay, defined as delayed but eventually normal growth in an adolescent, is usually genetic.  If evaluation of the short adolescent male reveals no evidence of chronic disease, if his sexual maturity rating is 2 or 3, and if his height is appropriate for skeletal age he can be told without endocrinologic testing that he will begin to grow taller within a year or so.  Adult height may be below average, but cannot be predicted reliably.  Average sexual maturity ratings for a male of 14.3 years are 4 for genitalia and 3 to 4 for pubic hair.  The history and physical examination would have given clues to any illnesses or nutritional problems. Ref: Kliegman RM, Behrman RE, Jenson HB, et al (eds): Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, ed 18.
