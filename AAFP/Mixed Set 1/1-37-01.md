Sertraline (Zoloft)

Because of their favorable side-effect profile and low cost, SSRIs are the first-line agents for late-life depression. SNRIs may be used as second-line agents when remission is not obtained with an SSRI. Tricyclic antidepressants work as well as SSRIs and may be considered in recalcitrant cases, but side effects may be troublesome, especially in this age group. The use of stimulants in depressed older adults has not been well studied. Second-generation antipsychotic agents may be used as an add-on to an SSRI or SNRI medication when the depression is resistant. Side effects and long-term safety may be issues with this approach.
