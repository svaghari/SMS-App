Plasma aldosterone/renin activity

In young patients with hypertension it is important to consider secondary causes in addition to the more common essential hypertension. This patientâ€™s relatively young age and elevated home blood pressure readings despite drug therapy warrant further evaluation. The initial evaluation showed hypokalemia, which suggests an endocrine cause of hypertension, specifically hyperaldosteronism. Other potential causes of secondary hypertension include coarctation of the aorta, renal artery stenosis, thyroid disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, pheochromocytoma, and Cushing syndrome. Each of these presents with clinical findings that help to distinguish them from other potential causes, and the laboratory evaluation would depend on the suspected cause.
