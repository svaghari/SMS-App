Prednisone

This patient has sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) of the left ear without any accompanying features to suggest a clear underlying cause. An appropriate evaluation will fail to identify a cause in 85%–90% of cases. Idiopathic SSNHL can be diagnosed if a patient is found to have a 30-dB hearing loss at three consecutive frequencies and an underlying condition is not identified by the history and physical examination.
The most recent guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery recommends that oral corticosteroids be considered as first-line therapy for patients who do not have a contraindication. While there is equivocal evidence of benefit, for most patients the risk of a short-term course of corticosteroids is thought to be outweighed by the potential benefit, especially when considering the serious consequences of long-term profound hearing loss. Because the greatest improvement in hearing tends to occur in the first 2 weeks, corticosteroid treatment should be started immediately. The recommended dosage is 1 mg/kg/day with a maximum dosage of 60 mg daily for 10–14 days.

Antiviral medications, antiplatelet agents, and vasodilators such as nifedipine have no evidence of benefit. Antibiotics also have no evidence of benefit in the absence of signs of infection.
