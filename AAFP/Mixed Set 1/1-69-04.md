A serum creatine kinase leve

The diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common neuromuscular disorder of childhood, is usually not made until the affected individual presents with an established gait abnormality at the age of 4â€“5 years. By then, parents unaware of the X-linked inheritance may have had additional children who would also be at risk.

The disease can be diagnosed earlier by testing for elevated creatine kinase in boys who are slow to walk. The mean age for walking in affected boys is 17.2 months, whereas over 75% of developmentally normal children in the United States walk by 13.5 months. Massive elevation of creatine kinase from 20 to 100 times normal occurs in every young infant with the disease. Early detection allows appropriate genetic counseling regarding future pregnancies.

Hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria could present as delayed walking. However, these diseases cause significant intellectual disability and would be associated with global developmental delay. Furthermore, these disorders are now diagnosed in the neonatal period by routine screening. Disorders of amino acid metabolism present in the newborn period with failure to thrive, poor feeding, and lethargy. Gross chromosomal abnormalities would usually be incompatible with a normal physical examination at 18 months of age.
