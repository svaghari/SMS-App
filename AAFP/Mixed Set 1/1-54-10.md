No difference in clinical outcome

A 5-day course of antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia produces the same clinical success rates as longer treatment programs. There is no difference in the rate of clinical improvement, hospital readmissions, or mortality between longer or shorter treatment courses. Patients are often discharged from the hospital before significant clinical improvement occurs, leading both patients and physicians to believe that longer antibiotic courses must be prescribed. Physicians must educate their patients about the benefit of shorter antibiotic courses, including fewer adverse effects, lower cost, and lower rates of bacterial resistance.
