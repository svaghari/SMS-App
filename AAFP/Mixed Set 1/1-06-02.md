somatic symptom disorder

Somatic symptom disorder (formerly called somatization disorder) usually begins in the teens or twenties and is characterized by multiple unexplained physical symptoms, insistence on surgical procedures, and an imprecise or inaccurate medical history. These patients also commonly abuse alcohol, narcotics, or other drugs.

Patients with illness anxiety disorder are overly concerned with bodily functions, and can often provide accurate, extensive, and detailed medical histories. Malingering is an intentional pretense of illness to obtain personal gain. Patients with panic disorder have episodes of intense, short-lived attacks of cardiovascular, neurologic, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by unrealistic worry about life circumstances accompanied by symptoms of motor tension, autonomic hyperactivity, or vigilance and scanning.
