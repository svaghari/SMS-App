St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)

St. John’s wort can reduce the effectiveness of multiple medications because it is an inducer of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein synthesis. Concurrent use of St. John’s wort with drugs that are metabolized with these systems should be avoided. These include cyclosporine, warfarin, theophylline, and oral contraceptives. St. John’s wort should be avoided in patients taking either over-the-counter or prescription medications.
