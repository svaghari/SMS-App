A corticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test

This patient has signs and symptoms consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). In Western countries autoimmunity is responsible for 90% of these cases. Because the corticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test has a higher degree of sensitivity and specificity than morning cortisol and ACTH concentrations, it is the preferred test in all patients with possible primary adrenal insufficiency. Serum aldosterone paired with plasma renin activity is used to screen for adrenal hyperplasia in hypertensive patients and also for establishing the existence of mineralocorticoid insufficiency in patients with PAI. Once the diagnosis is established, 21-hydroxylase antibodies and 17-hydroxylase progesterone levels are used to determine the etiology of PAI.
