One long-acting niacin tablet per day

Hepatotoxicity resulting from timed-release formulations of niacin has been reported in elderly individuals. Patients may be taking this supplement without their physicianâ€™s knowledge, feeling it is safe because it is a vitamin. Aspirin and vitamin C can result in gastrointestinal iron loss and anemia. The other medications listed, if used in moderation, would not be expected to alter laboratory findings.
