Hyponatremia

Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination syndrome, or central pontine myelinolysis, sometimes resulting in permanent neurologic deficits after a brief improvement in neurologic status. Signs and symptoms may include dysarthria, dysphagia, paresis, coma, and seizures. It is believed that brain volume shrinks because it cannot assimilate the new electrolytes fast enough and water is lost from the cells. Rapid correction of hypernatremia that has been present for a short time is relatively safe. Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening condition that should be corrected promptly. Rapid correction of hypoglycemia is not an issue. Overly rapid correction of hyperglycemia and subsequent cerebral edema is unusual and is primarily seen in children.
