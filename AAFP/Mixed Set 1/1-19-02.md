Budesonide oral suspension, 1 mg twice daily

The clinical presentation and esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings indicate eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)
in this patient. In the absence of other causes of eosinophilia, the presence of >15 eosinophils/hpf is
considered diagnostic. Application of corticosteroids to the esophagus is generally the treatment of choice,
either in the form of an oral suspension of budesonide or an inhaled corticosteroid sprayed into the mouth
and swallowed. Although EoE can occur in patients with other atopic illnesses, this patient does not have
any symptoms of allergies or asthma, so an antihistamine such as fexofenadine is not needed. EoE does
not respond to proton pump inhibitor therapy or H2-blocker therapy and systemic corticosteroids are not
necessary.
