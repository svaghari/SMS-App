Meta-analyses

In general, the strongest evidence for treatment, screening, or prevention strategies is found in systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with consistent findings, or a single high-quality RCT. Second-tier levels of evidence include poorer quality RCTs with inconsistent findings, cohort studies, or case-control studies. The lowest quality of evidence comes from sources such as expert opinion, consensus guidelines, or usual practice recommendations.
