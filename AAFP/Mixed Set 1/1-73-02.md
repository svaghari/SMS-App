The medical record should be released only with written permission from a patient or legal representative

Permission for the release of patient information should always be in writing.  Although the actual medical record is the property of the physician, the information in the chart is the property of the patient.  Ethically and legally, patients have a right to the information in their medical records, and it cannot be withheld from the patient or a third party (at the request of the patient), even if medical bills are unpaid or the physician is concerned about the patient.
