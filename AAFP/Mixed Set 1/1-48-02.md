Home with close monitoring

For community-acquired pneumonia, an important decision point is the severity of illness that indicates the need for inpatient care. There are multiple tools for evaluation of pneumonia severity, including SMART-COP (predicts the likelihood of the need for invasive ventilation or vasopressor support), the Pneumonia Severity Index (predicts the risk of 30-day mortality and the need for admission to the intensive-care unit), and CURB-65 or CRB-65. In an outpatient setting, CURB-65 and CRB-65 are easy to use, although they have weaker predictive values for 30-day mortality. In addition, clinical judgment should always be used. In this scenario, the patient does not clinically appear markedly ill, and her vital signs and physical examination do not fit any criteria for increased risk in any of the scoring systems. Her only risk factor is age ï‚³65 years, and those with zero or one criteria for CURB-65 or CRB-65 can be managed as outpatients.
