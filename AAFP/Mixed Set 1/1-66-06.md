subluxation of the head of the radius

Subluxation of the radial head, or nursemaid’s elbow, is one of the most common injuries in children under 5 years of age. It occurs when the child’s hand is suddenly jerked up, forcing the elbow into extension and causing the radial head to slip out from the annular ligament.
