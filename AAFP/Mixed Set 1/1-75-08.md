Prevention traditionally has been divided into three categories:  primary, secondary, and tertiary.  Primary prevention targets individuals who may be at risk to develop a medical condition and intervenes to prevent the onset of that condition (e.g., childhood vaccination programs, water fluoridation, antismoking programs, and education about safe sex).  Secondary prevention targets individuals who have developed an asymptomatic disease and institutes treatment to prevent complications (e.g., routine Papanicolaou smears, and screening for hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia).  Tertiary prevention targets individuals with a known disease, with the goal of limiting or preventing future complications (e.g., screening diabetics for microalbuminuria, rigorous treatment of diabetes mellitus, and post-myocardial infarction prophylaxis with Î²-blockers and aspirin).
