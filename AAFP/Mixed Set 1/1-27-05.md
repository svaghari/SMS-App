there is a public health risk

There are three situations when a breach of confidentiality is justified: abuse of a vulnerable person (child or elderly), a public health risk (communicable disease), or substantial danger to the patient or others. While Chlamydia is not usually considered life-threatening or dangerous, it is communicable. Contacting sexual partners to notify and treat them to stem the spread of disease is recommended.
