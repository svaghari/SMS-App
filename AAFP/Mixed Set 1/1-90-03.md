Flexible flat feet as described are not pathologic unless painful, which is uncommon. Flexibility of the flat foot is determined by appearance of an arch when the feet are not bearing weight. No treatment is indicated for painless flexible flatfoot. Spontaneous correction is usually expected within 1 year of walking. Ref: Sass P, Hassan G: Lower extremity abnormalities in children.
