tarsal tunnel syndrome

Entrapment of the posterior tibial nerve or its branches as the nerve courses behind the medial malleolus results in a neuritis known as tarsal tunnel syndrome.  Causes of compression within the tarsal tunnel include varices of the posterior tibial vein, tenosynovitis of the flexor tendon, structural alteration of the tunnel secondary to trauma, and direct compression of the nerve.  Pronation of the foot causes pain and paresthesias in the medial aspect of the ankle and heel, and sometimes the plantar surface of the foot. The usual site for a stress fracture is the shaft of the second, third, or fourth metatarsals.  A herniated nucleus pulposus would produce reflex and sensory changes.  Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain in runners and often presents with pain at the beginning of the workout.  The pain decreases during running only to recur afterward.  Diabetic neuropathy is usually bilateral and often produces paresthesias and burning at night, with absent or decreased deep tendon reflexes. Ref: Brukner P, Khan K: Clinical Sports Medicine, ed 3.
