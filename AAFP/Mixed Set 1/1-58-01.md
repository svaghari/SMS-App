No talking, whispering, or throat clearing for 48 hours

Complete vocal rest, including no whispering or throat clearing, is the most effective and quickest initial remedy for short-duration laryngitis, whether viral or due to vocal overuse or abuse. Limiting voice use or whispering, as opposed to complete vocal rest, will likely prolong and possibly worsen hoarseness. Clearing the throat of mucus should also be avoided for the same reason. Inhaled corticosteroids and antibiotics are not effective treatments for laryngitis. Hypertonic saline nebulization treatments would likely cause violent coughing fits that would worsen the condition. Nebulized ribavirin is never indicated for use in adults.
