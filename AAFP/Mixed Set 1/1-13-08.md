A diuretic, ACE inhibitor, and Î²-blocker until his symptoms and the abnormalities seen on the echocardiogram resolve

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, can develop following
emotional distress and is characterized by the abrupt onset of dysfunction of the left ventricle. The clinical
presentation and laboratory studies can mirror acute coronary syndrome and should be treated similarly.
Once symptoms and cardiac abnormalities resolve, treatment is no longer indicated and may be withdrawn
if there are no signs of coronary disease. Because this patient currently has cardiomyopathic abnormalities,
a diuretic, ACE inhibitor, and -blocker are indicated. Ambulatory cardiac monitors are not indicated for
this patient with a known diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. A pacemaker is not indicated in the
absence of arrhythmias caused by conduction abnormalities.
