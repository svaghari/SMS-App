Padding, ice, and elevation

This patient has olecranon bursitis, which is a superficial bursitis caused by chronic microtraumas to the
affected area. The initial management for this condition includes conservative measures such as padding,
elevation, icing, and analgesics (SOR B). If significant pain is associated with the swelling, or a decrease
in range of motion is present due to severe swelling, aspiration should be offered. This is not indicated in
this particular case and should be avoided to reduce the risk of septic bursitis. Septic bursitis would require
empiric antibiotics to cover common skin organisms (SOR B). Aspiration should be performed if infection
is suspected and the aspirate should be sent for a cell count, Gram stain, culture, glucose measurement,
and crystal analysis (SOR C). Plain radiographs are indicated only if there is acute trauma and concern that
a fracture may be present. If recurrent superficial bursitis occurs, a referral for surgery is indicated.
