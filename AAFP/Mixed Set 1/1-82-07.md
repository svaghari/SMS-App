Most of the drugs available from Canada come from the same manufacturers as in the U.S.

The FDA has approved more than 90% of the drugs available from Canada. Most of these drugs come from the same manufacturers as drugs in the U.S. Health Canada takes longer, on average, to approve a drug for release than does the FDA, and most drugs discontinued for safety reasons by the FDA between 1992 and 2001 had not been approved for use in Canada. Websites advertising Canadian drugs may be selling counterfeit drugs from unregulated sources. Ref: Safety of Canadian drugs. Med Lett Drugs Ther 2003;45:100.
