Number needed to treat

A basic understanding of statistics is essential to evaluate clinical evidence. The number needed to treat,
which represents the number of patients that must be treated to result in one positive outcome, is one of
the most intuitive statistical concepts in explaining the power or relative lack thereof of an intervention.
Relative risk reduction in particular can be misleading, since a seemingly large relative risk reduction may
result in a very small absolute risk reduction if the prevalence of the disorder in question is low. Specificity
indicates the ability of a test to accurately identify a condition but does not indicate the effectiveness of an
intervention. A 95% confidence interval relates to statistical variation and the relationship of an outcome
to chance. P-value deals with statistical significance but not magnitude of the effect.
