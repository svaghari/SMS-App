A skeletal muscle relaxant and an NSAID

This patient has acute to subacute nonspecific low back pain. Combination treatment with an NSAID and a skeletal muscle relaxant is recommended as second-line therapy when an NSAID is ineffective as monotherapy. Opioids have not been shown to have significant benefit when added to an NSAID and would not be recommended as a second-line treatment. Systemic corticosteroids do not have evidence to support their use in the treatment of acute nonspecific back pain. Gabapentin does not have evidence to support its use in treating acute back pain and has been shown to produce only minimal improvement in chronic back pain. This patient has no red-flag symptoms so imaging studies are not recommended at this time.
