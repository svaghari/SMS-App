Radioactive iodine uptake

Postpartum thyroiditis is defined as a transient or persistent thyroid dysfunction that occurs within 1 year
of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Release of preformed thyroid hormone in the bloodstream
initially results in hyperthyroidism. During the hyperthyroid phase, radioactive iodine uptake will be low,
which can help to confirm the diagnosis. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are contraindications to radionuclide
imaging. Thyroid peroxidase antibody levels are elevated with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis
(Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis), and patients present with symptoms of hypothyroidism. The Endocrine Society
and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists do not recommend routine thyroid ultrasonography
in patients with abnormal thyroid function tests if there is no palpable abnormality of the thyroid gland.
Thyrotropin receptor antibody levels are positive in Graves disease.
