Supportive treatment only

No pharmacologic treatment shortens the course of viral bronchiolitis in a young child. Supplemental oxygen is indicated if the oxygen saturation falls below 90%, but otherwise the most effective treatment is simply supportive care (fluids, antipyretics, nasal bulb suction, etc.). None of the pharmacologic options listed are recommended in the treatment of bronchiolitis in this scenario.
