lithium

This patient is experiencing a manic or hypomanic episode. Therapeutic options include lithium,
anticonvulsants such as divalproex, and antipsychotic medications such as olanzapine. Benzodiazepines
such as lorazepam may be of minimal benefit. SSRIs such as sertraline can aggravate mania. Bupropion
would help treat an associated depression and trazodone could possibly help the patient sleep, but these
medications are ineffective for treating a manic/hypomanic episode.
