Sertraline (Zoloft)

Amitriptyline, doxepin, MAO inhibitors, and clomipramine should be avoided in nursing-home patients. SSRIs are the most appropriate first-line pharmacologic treatment for depression in nursing-home residents. Other classes of non-tricyclic antidepressants may be effective and appropriate, but the evidence for this is not as good as the evidence for SSRIs.
