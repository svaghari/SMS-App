Further observation

A hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis testis occurs frequently at birth but usually resolves in a few weeks or months.  No treatment is indicated during the first year of life unless there is a clinically evident hernia.  A simple scrotal hydrocele without communication with the peritoneal cavity and no associated hernia should be excised if it has not spontaneously resolved by the age of 12 months.  Aspirating the mass for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons is not recommended, since a loop of bowel may be injured.  Removing the fluid is ineffectiveas it will quickly reaccumulate.
