Pelvic floor muscle training and bladder training

Nonpharmacologic therapy is recommended for all patients with an overactive bladder.  Pelvic floor muscle training (e.g., Kegel exercises) and bladder training are proven effective in urge incontinence or overactive bladder, as well as in stress and mixed incontinence.  In motivated patients, training may be more effective than medications such as oxybutynin and newer muscarinic receptor antagonists such as solifenacin.  Tamsulosin is used in benign prostatic hypertrophy and phenazopyridine is a urinary tract anesthetic that has not been recommended for treating overactive bladder.
