The etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon)

Cigarette smoking, increasing age, and exogenous estrogen, particularly at the supraphysiologic doses used in contraceptives, all increase risk for vascular events such as venous thromboembolism and stroke. The use of estrogen-containing contraception in smokers â‰¥35 years is contraindicated because of this risk. All of the contraceptive options listed contain estrogen except for the etonogestrel implant. Other progestin-only contraceptive options that could be considered include depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, and progestin-only oral contraceptive pills.
