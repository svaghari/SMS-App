α1-Antitrypsin deficiency

This patient is a nonsmoker but has typical symptoms and findings of COPD. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency should be considered in patients with very premature COPD or in patients without risk factors for COPD such as smoking, secondhand smoke exposure, or other smoke exposure. Dyspnea would be present and lung function would be normal in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Hemochromatosis may cause liver function abnormalities but not abnormal lung function. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is associated with asthma, not COPD.
