MRI

This patient has a calcaneal stress fracture as suggested by the history of increased running on a hard
surface, improvement with rest, and a positive calcaneal squeeze on examination. A delay in diagnosis
increases the risk of delayed union. MRI is the preferred imaging modality because radiographs often do
not detect a calcaneal stress fracture. A C-reactive protein level could be indicated if there were symptoms
or signs of infection or autoimmune illness. The clinical picture does not suggest a neurologic condition,
so nerve conduction velocity testing is not appropriate. While there are some case reports of the diagnosis
of stress fractures using ultrasonography, this is not the preferred imaging method.
