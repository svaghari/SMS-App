Strabismus

Strabismus is an ocular misalignment that can be diagnosed on a cover/uncover test when the corneal light reflex is deviated from its normal position slightly nasal to mid-pupil.  The misaligned eye then moves to fixate on a held object when the opposite eye is covered.  The eye drifts back to its original position when the opposite eye is uncovered. Amblyopia is cortical visual impairment from abnormal eye development-most often as a result of strabismus.  Cataract is a less frequent cause of amblyopia.  Esotropia is a type of strabismus with an inward or nasal deviation of the eye that would be evidenced by a corneal light reflex lateral to its normal position.  (The outward eye deviation seen in this patient is exotropia.)  Heterophoria, or latent strabismus, does not cause eye deviation when both eyes are uncovered. Ref: Doshi NR, Rodriguez ML: Amblyopia.
