Recurrent or persistent upper respiratory symptoms

Despite 10%–30% of the population being affected by allergic disease, allergy testing does have limitations
and is most useful in certain clinical situations. Allergy testing can be helpful in patients with persistent
sinus infections, allergic rhinitis, and poorly controlled asthma. Allergy testing for insect stings is indicated
only following systemic/anaphylactic or large local reactions, not with limited localized reactions. Three
days of fever followed by a diffuse urticarial rash likely represents a rash associated with a limited viral
illness. Allergy testing for penicillin has a negative predictive value of 95%–98%. Testing for allergy to
other antibiotics has a much lower sensitivity and specificity but does have limited use to help guide
medication choices in patients with multiple allergies and when limited antibiotic options are available.
Persistent epigastric pain following the ingestion of tomato products is more indicative of acid reflux
symptoms rather than a tomato allergy.
