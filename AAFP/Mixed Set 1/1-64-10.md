Pulmonary embolism

The protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in pleural fluid can help differentiate between
transudative and exudative effusions. Light’s criteria (pleural fluid protein to serum protein ratio >0.5,
pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH ratio >0.6, and/or pleural LDH >0.67 times the upper limit of normal
for serum LDH) are 99.5% sensitive for diagnosing exudative effusions and differentiate exudative from
transudative effusions in 93%–96% of cases. Of the listed pleural effusion etiologies, only pulmonary
embolism is exudative. The remainder are all transudative.
