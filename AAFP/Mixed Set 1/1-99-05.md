Metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL)

β-Blockers are first-line antihypertensive medications for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and have been shown to reduce the risk of death by 23% at 2 years. They should also be given to normotensive patients with CAD if tolerated. Cardioselective (β1) β-blockers such as metoprolol and atenolol are preferred, as they cause fewer adverse effects.
