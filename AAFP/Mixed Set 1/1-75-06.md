Ultrasonography of the kidneys, urine cytology, and cystoscopy

The American Urological Association (AUA) defines clinically significant microscopic hematuria as â‰¥3 RBCs/hpf.  Microscopic hematuria is frequently an incidental finding, but may be associated with urologic malignancy in up to 10% of adults. The upper urinary tract should be evaluated in this patient.  There are no clear evidence-based imaging guidelines for upper tract evaluation; therefore, intravenous urography, ultrasonography, or CT can be considered.  Ultrasonography is the least expensive and safest choice because it does not expose the patient to intravenous radiographic contrast media. Urine cytology and cystoscopy are used routinely to evaluate the lower urinary tract.  The AUA recommends that patients with microscopic hematuria have radiographic assessment of the upper urinary tract, followed by urine cytology studies.  The AUA also recommends that all patients older than 40 and those who are younger but have risk factors for bladder cancer undergo cystoscopy to complete the evaluation.  Cystoscopy is the only reliable method of detecting transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and urethra. Ref: McDonald MM, Swagerty D, Wetzel L: Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults.
