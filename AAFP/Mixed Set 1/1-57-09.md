azithromycin (Zithromax)

In a young adult with community-acquired pneumonia who is not sick enough to be hospitalized, the current recommendation is to empirically treat with a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin. This covers the atypical organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which is one of the most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia. Certain fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin also cover atypical causes, but ciprofloxacin does not. The other antibiotics listed are also ineffective against Mycoplasma.
