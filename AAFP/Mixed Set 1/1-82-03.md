Atypical glandular cells not otherwise specified (AGC-NOS)

Papanicolaou (Pap) tests are intended to screen for cervical cancer, but most abnormal Pap tests are associated with precancerous lesions or with no abnormality. The category of atypical glandular cells not otherwise specified (AGC-NOS) has a benign sound to it, although it is associated with a 17% rate of cancer (8% carcinoma in situ and 9% invasive carcinoma). High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), which would seem worse intuitively, has only a 3% associated cancer rate. AGC-NOS is associated with higher rates of cancer than the other choices listed. Ref: Apgar BS, Brotzman G: Management of cervical cytologic abnormalities. Am Fam Physician 2004;70(10):1905-1916.
