Blocking intestinal absorption of phosphate, which lowers parathyroid hormone secretion

This patient has secondary hyperparathyroidism, a common cause of hypercalcemia in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Sevelamer is a newer synthetic agent in the therapeutic class of phosphate binders, which includes calcium acetate. Decreasing serum phosphate lowers the feedback stimulation of parathyroid hormone secretion by the parathyroid gland, which is often excessive in chronic renal insufficiency. Normalizing parathyroid levels improves serum calcium levels.
