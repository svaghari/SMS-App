A reduction of dose, an increase in dosing interval, or both may be necessary

Many medications require dosage adjustments in patients with chronic kidney disease.  Medications are adjusted based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or creatinine clearance.  Most medication adjustments require a reduction in the dose, lengthening of the dosing interval, or both.  Loading doses of medications usually do not need to be adjusted. Medication adjustments are divided into three groups, based on whether the GFR is >50 mL/min/1.73m2, 10-50 mL/min/1.73m2, or <10 mL/min/1.73m2.  The production and excretion of creatinine decreases in older patients, so a normal serum creatinine level does not always correlate with normal kidney function.  Serum drug levels typically are not required for adjusting medications in patients with chronic kidney disease.
