dual antiplatelet therapy and an anticoagulant

This patient is likely experiencing an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction with possible incipient
cardiogenic shock. Along with initiating the hospitalâ€™s protocol for myocardial infarction, immediate
treatment should include dual antiplatelet therapy with a 325-mg dose of nonenteric aspirin, a P2Y12
inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor), and an anticoagulant (unfractionated heparin or
bivalirudin). Given the possibility of cardiogenic shock, -blockers should not be used. Unless more than
a 2-hour delay in percutaneous coronary intervention is expected, fibrinolytics should not be administered.
An intravenous vasopressor is not indicated.
