Start warfarin now and stop dabigatran in 3 days

The recommendation for switching to warfarin in a patient treated with dabigatran is to start warfarin 3 days prior to stopping dabigatran. Bridging with a parenteral agent is not necessary. Dabigatran is known to increase the INR, so the INR will not reflect warfarinâ€™s effect until dabigatran has been withheld for at least 2 days.
