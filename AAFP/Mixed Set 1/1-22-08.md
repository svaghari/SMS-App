Chronic pulmonary emboli

Low diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) with normal spirometry indicates a disease process that disrupts gas transfer in the lungs without causing lung restriction or airflow obstruction. Common causes include chronic pulmonary emboli, heart failure, connective tissue disease with pulmonary involvement, and primary pulmonary hypertension. Asthma, bronchiectasis, COPD, and pulmonary fibrosis are associated with abnormalities on spirometry.
