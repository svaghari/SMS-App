Washing hands frequently

Traveler’s diarrhea is caused predominantly by bacterial pathogens (up to 80%–90%) and is associated with hygiene practices. Handwashing has been shown to reduce the risk of traveler’s diarrhea by 30%. The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer is also effective. Although it is considered traditional advice, avoiding street vendor foods, tap water, ice, and raw foods has not been shown to reduce the risk of traveler’s diarrhea. There is not sufficient evidence to recommend taking a probiotic to reduce the risk of traveler’s diarrhea. Due to concerns about antimicrobial resistance and altering protective bowel flora, taking prophylactic antibiotics is generally not recommended for healthy travelers. However, using an antibiotic for as-needed treatment is appropriate.
