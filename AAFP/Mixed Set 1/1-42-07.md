life expectancy

Eligibility for hospice care is based on a life expectancy of 6 months or less in the natural course of an illness. A majority of hospice patients have cancer but it is not a requirement to qualify for hospice care. Age is not relevant. Comorbid conditions may affect longevity but are not required. For those insured by Medicare, Medicare Part A provides hospice care but Medicare Part B does not.
