Initial complete cognitive and physical rest followed by an individualized graded return to activity

This patient has symptoms typical of a mild concussion without loss of consciousness. In such cases
standard neuroimaging can be expected to be normal. The evaluation should include a standard concussion
assessment tool, and if concussion is suspected the athlete should be removed from play. Complete physical
and cognitive rest are required for the first 1–2 days, but return to normal activity must be individualized
depending on the course of symptoms and response to gradually increasing activity. Athletes should be
completely free of symptoms before returning to sports activities.
