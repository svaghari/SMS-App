Levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol

The Endocrine Society recommends hormonal contraception as the first-line medication for women diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who are experiencing irregular menses, acne, and hirsutism and do not desire pregnancy (SOR A). Metformin may help regulate menses but has not been shown to be as effective as oral hormone therapy. In a 2015 Cochrane review, oral contraceptives were recommended as the most effective treatment for hirsutism. Either letrozole or clomiphene is appropriate for women diagnosed with PCOS who want to become pregnant.
