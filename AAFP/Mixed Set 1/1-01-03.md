Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX)

This patient presents with symptoms compatible with functional constipation. Daily use of polyethylene
glycol (PEG) solution has been found to be more effective than lactulose, senna, or magnesium hydroxide
in head-to-head studies. Evidence does not support the use of fiber supplements in the treatment of
functional constipation. No adverse effects were reported with PEG therapy at any dosing regimen.
Low-dose regimens of PEG are 0.3 g/kg/day and high-dose regimens are up to 1.0â€“1.5 g/kg/day.
