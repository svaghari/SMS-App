Transvaginal ultrasonography

Abnormal uterine bleeding can be a sign of endometrial cancer in premenopausal women, who account for 20% of cases of endometrial cancer. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women with abnormal uterine bleeding should be evaluated for endometrial cancer if they are older than 45 years or if they have a history of unopposed estrogen exposure (SOR C). Most guidelines recommend either transvaginal ultrasonography or endometrial biopsy as the initial study in the evaluation of endometrial cancer. Transvaginal ultrasonography is often preferred as the initial study because of its availability, cost-effectiveness, and high sensitivity. If bleeding persists despite normal transvaginal ultrasonography a tissue biopsy should be performed. The listed hormonal treatment options may be appropriate once cancer is ruled out. An FSH level can help determine whether someone is menopausal or approaching menopause, in which case they will likely be missing periods. Continued observation would only delay the diagnosis.
