Topiramate (Topamax)

Topiramate increases the risk of kidney stones. It is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which induces a
metabolic acidosis that leads to hypercalciuria and the formation of calcium phosphate stones. The risk of
kidney stones is not increased by escitalopram, levothyroxine, lisinopril, or metformin.
