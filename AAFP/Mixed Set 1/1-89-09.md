Malathion (Ovide)

Malathion is currently the most effective treatment for head lice and is less toxic than lindane. Permethrin and pyrethrins are less effective than malathion, although they are acceptable alternatives. These insecticides, as well as lindane, are not recommended in children 2 years of age or younger. Wet combing may be effective, but is less than half as effective as malathion. Head shaving is only temporarily effective and is traumatic. Petrolatum is not proven to be effective. Ref: Roberts RJ: Head lice. N Engl J Med 2002;346(21):1645-1650.
