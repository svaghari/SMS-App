Pulmonary embolism

Pulmonary emboli, anastomotic leaks, and respiratory failure are responsible for 80% of deaths in the 30 days following bariatric surgery, with death from pulmonary embolism being the most frequent cause.  Wound infections and marginal ulcers are common complications of this type of surgery. Ref: Virgi A, Murr MM: Caring for patients after bariatric surgery. Am Fam Physician 2006;73(8):1403-1408.
