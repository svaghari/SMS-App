Add topical calcipotriene (Dovonex, Sorilux)

Oral corticosteroids are not indicated in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. All of the other options are indicated only if topical treatments fail. Of the options listed, the combination of a topical corticosteroid and topical calcipotriene is considered the most appropriate for this patient. Another option would be to add topical tazarotene to the topical corticosteroid. However, when tazarotene is used as monotherapy it often fails to clear plaques and increases the incidence of skin irritation.
