Topical mupirocin (Bactroban)

Topical mupirocin is as effective as cephalexin or amoxicillin/clavulanate in the treatment of impetigo, which is most often caused by Staphlococcal species.  Oral penicillin V, oral erythromycin, and topical bacitracin are less effective than mupirocin.  Topical treatment is well suited to this localized lesion.  Topical disinfectants such as hydrogen peroxide are no more effective than placebo. Ref: Cole C, Gazewood J: Diagnosis and treatment of impetigo. Am Fam Physician 2007;75(6):859-864.
