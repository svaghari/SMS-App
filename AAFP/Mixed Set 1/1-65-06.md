Statin-induced myopathy

This patient is most likely suffering from a drug-induced myopathy caused by the simvastatin, which is associated with elevated creatine kinase. Polymyalgia rheumatica is usually associated with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Guillain-Barr√© syndrome is associated with depressed deep tendon reflexes. This case has no clinical features or laboratory findings that suggest ketoacidosis.
