Determine and treat the underlying cause of the behavior change

This patient has hyperactive delirium. The first step in management is to determine and treat the underlying cause if possible. There are multiple causes of delirium such as medications, infections, metabolic abnormalities, and underlying diseases. The first step in treatment is behavioral management with strategies to orient the patient. Haloperidol or antipsychotics may be used if the patient is at risk of harm. Lorazepam and anticholinergics should both be avoided, as they can worsen delirium. Restraints can also worsen the agitation and should not be used. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant and is not used in the treatment of delirium.
