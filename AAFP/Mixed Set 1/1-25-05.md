amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)

In the first 3 to 4 days of illness, viral rhinosinusitis cannot be distinguished from early acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. If the patient seems to be improving and then symptoms start to worsen on days 5–10 of the illness (double sickening), acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be suspected. The color of the nasal discharge should not be used as the sole indication for antibiotic therapy. One study showed that unilateral predominance with purulent rhinorrhea had an overall reliability of 85% for diagnosing sinusitis. After 10 days of upper respiratory symptoms, the probability of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is 60%.

Antibiotic therapy should be considered if the patient does not improve after 7–10 days from the onset of symptoms or if the symptoms worsen at any time. According to most guidelines, the first-line antibiotic for treatment of adults with sinusitis is amoxicillin/clavulanate. Respiratory fluoroquinolones are not recommended as first-line medications, as they offer no additional benefits and have significant side effects. Second
and third-generation cephalosporins, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and macrolide antibiotics are no longer recommended for initial therapy. This is due to high rates of resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae .
