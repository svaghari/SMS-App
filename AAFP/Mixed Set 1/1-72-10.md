If they suspect that a child has experienced abuse or neglect

Although each state has its own laws regarding obligations to report child abuse, all 50 U.S. states require physicians, whether as a specified professional group or as a part of universal mandated reporting, to report a suspicion of child abuse. The standard is generally suspicion or cause to believe that abuse has occurred. If the possibility of abuse is briefly considered but rejected, or if nonspecific signs are present that do not create a significant suspicion of abuse, this standard is not met. There is no burden of proof placed on the physician to make such a report.
