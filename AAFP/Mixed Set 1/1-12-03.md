Inability to follow one-step directions

At 18 months of age a child should follow one-step directions. Approximately 90% of 18-month-olds say
at least three words, and 50%â€“90% say six words. The ability to point to body parts or pictures after they
are named is expected at 2 years of age. Not walking at 18 months would be a red flag for delay, but
running well may not yet be accomplished. At 18 months a child would be expected to scribble
spontaneously but not to copy a vertical line.
