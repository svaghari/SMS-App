A history and physical examination only

Breast cancer survivors should undergo a history and physical examination every 3–6 months for the first
3 years after treatment, then every 6–12 months for the next 2 years, and then annually thereafter (SOR
C).
Papanicolaou testing guidelines do not change for patients with a history of breast cancer. Screening should
be repeated every 3–5 years according to American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology
(ASCCP) guidelines.
Mammograms of both breasts or the remaining breast are recommended no more often than yearly (SOR
A). Breast MRI is not recommended on a regular basis unless the patient has a high risk of recurrence,
a significant family history of breast or ovarian cancer, or a personal history of Hodgkin’s disease (SOR
C). While it is important to be alert for signs of cardiotoxicity due to prior chemotherapy,
echocardiography is indicated only if the patient has cardiac symptoms. Routine echocardiography is not
recommended (SOR C).
