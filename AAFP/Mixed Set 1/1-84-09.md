Shift-work insomnia

Shift-work insomnia is the only circadian sleep disorder listed. It may respond to bright-light therapy. Alcoholism is a behavioral disorder that may respond to gradual discontinuance. Inadequate sleep hygiene (use of stimulants at night, sleeping other than at bedtime, etc.) may respond to habit changes. Sleep-related myoclonus is an intrinsic sleep disorder and can be treated with levodopa or clonazepam. Ref: Sadock BJ, Sadock VA (eds): Kaplan & Sadock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, ed 8.
