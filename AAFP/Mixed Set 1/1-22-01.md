Tap water

This patient has a stage 2 pressure ulcer. It is recommended that pressure ulcers not be cleaned with povidone/iodine, Dakinâ€™s solution, hydrogen peroxide, wet-to-dry dressings, or any solutions that may impede granulation tissue formation. These sites should be cleaned with either saline or tap water and covered with hydrocolloid, foam, or another nonadherent dressing that promotes a moist environment.
