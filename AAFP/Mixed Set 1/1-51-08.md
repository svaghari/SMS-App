Tiotropium (Spiriva)

A Cochrane review found that the long-acting antimuscarinic agent tiotropium improved quality of life and reduced exacerbations and exacerbation-related hospitalizations in patients with underlying COPD. Tiotropium was noted to be superior to long-acting β-agonists such as salmeterol. Albuterol, fluticasone, and ipratropium have not been shown to have these effects (SOR A).
