Ginkgo biloba

Herbal and dietary supplements can affect the absorption, metabolism, and disposition of other drugs. Ginkgo biloba has been associated with serious intracerebral bleeding. In most of these patients, concurrent anticoagulant drugs were being used. Ginkgo has been shown in vitro to inhibit platelet aggregation and has been associated with case reports of spontaneous bleeding. Caution is recommended when using this supplement with aspirin or other anticoagulants. Kava is associated with gastrointestinal side effects and skin rashes. Yohimbine is associated with hypertension. Saw palmetto and echinacea are not associated with bleeding.
