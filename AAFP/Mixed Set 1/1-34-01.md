A gamma-glutamyl transferase level

When an otherwise healthy patient’s alkaline phosphatase level is elevated, it is helpful to determine whether the source of elevated isoenzymes is the liver or bone. One method is fractionation of the alkaline phosphatase by electrophoresis. A gamma-glutamyl transferase or 5 -nucleotidase level can also indicate whether the elevation of the alkaline phosphatase is from the liver. These enzymes are rarely elevated in conditions other than liver disease. Severe vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia with an elevated alkaline phosphatase.
