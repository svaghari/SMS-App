Legionella pneumophila

Pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila is commonly preceded by nonspecific systemic symptoms that may lead a clinician to consider other diagnoses. Symptoms may include high-grade fever, malaise, myalgias, anorexia, and headache. Gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms are also common and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and confusion. Focal neurologic signs are less common, but have been reported. Localizing respiratory symptoms will typically develop later, most often a dry cough and dyspnea. From this point on the illness resembles a typical pneumonia with fever, productive cough, pleuritic pain, and breathlessness.
