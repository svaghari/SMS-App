Elliiptical excision

This lesion is suspicious for melanoma, based on the asymmetry, irregular border, color variegation, and size larger than 6 mm. In addition, a history of evolution of the lesion, with changes in size, shape, or color, has been shown in some studies to be the most specific clinical finding for melanoma. The preferred method of biopsy for any lesion suspicious for melanoma is complete elliptical excision with a small margin of normal-appearing skin. The depth of the lesion is crucial to staging and prognosis, so shave biopsies are inadequate. A punch biopsy of the most suspicious-appearing area is appropriate if the location or size of the lesion makes full excision inappropriate or impractical, but a single punch biopsy is unlikely to capture the entire malignant portion in larger lesions. Electrodesiccation and curettage is not an appropriate treatment for melanoma. Mohs surgery is sometimes used to treat melanomas, but is not used for the initial diagnosis.
