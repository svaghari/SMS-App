Hypotension

Recent guidelines have suggested that hypotension (a systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure <60 mm Hg, for 15 minutes or longer) should be treated with thrombolysis in patients who are not at high risk for bleeding. Patients who have other indicators of cardiopulmonary impairment without signs of hypotension should be given anticoagulation therapy and aggressive supportive care, but should not be treated with thrombolytic therapy. If the patientâ€™s condition continues to deteriorate as evidenced by the development of hypotension or other clinical indicators of cardiopulmonary compromise, thrombolysis may be considered.
