No further evaluation

This 55-year-old patient is undergoing a low-risk procedure. While her diabetes mellitus is a cardiovascular risk factor, she is asymptomatic, her age lowers her risk, and her functional status is good. She should be allowed to undergo cataract surgery with no further evaluation. Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend that the patient be allowed to undergo surgery with no further testing.
