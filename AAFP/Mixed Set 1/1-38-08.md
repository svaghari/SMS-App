Adult patients with acute bronchitis rarely require a chest radiograph to rule out pneumonia. Indications for a chest radiograph include dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, temperature >100.0Â°F, bloody sputum, or signs of focal consolidation on lung auscultation. In patients with bronchitis the cough lasts an average of 18 days, so a chest radiograph would not be indicated after only 14 days. Smoking does not influence the need for a chest radiograph, and wheezing is common in uncomplicated acute bronchitis.
