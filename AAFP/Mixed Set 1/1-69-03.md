Increased caloric intake

This patient has exercise-related oligomenorrhea, but does not have the eating disorder that characterizes the female athlete triad. Menstrual problems in athletes do correlate with bone density loss and impaired recovery from exercise. Additionally, menstrual irregularity of varying severity is extremely common in female distance runners, perhaps affecting as many as 60%. Hormonal manipulation has not been shown to affect bone density, though it may produce withdrawal bleeding. Bisphosphonate therapy has been shown to be ineffective, and is not recommended in women of child-bearing age.
The main issue in well-nourished female athletes seems to be that energy intake is not increased to match energy expenditures at high levels of training. Unlike those with the female athlete triad, there is little evidence that athletes without eating disorders suffer substantial harm from exercise-induced menstrual problems. Ending an athletic career for this reason alone is not justified.
