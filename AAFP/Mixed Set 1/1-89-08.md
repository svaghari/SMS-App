200

Considering relative risk reduction without also considering the absolute rate can distort the importance of a therapy. A useful way to assess the importance of a therapy is to determine the number-needed-to-treat for that therapy. To calculate this number, the percentage of absolute risk reduction of a particular therapy is divided into 100. In the case in question, the absolute risk reduction would be 0.5% (0.5x.01). Thus, the number-needed-to-treat for the example cited would be 200 (100/0.5). Ref: Hart RG, Benavente O: Stroke: Part I. A clinical update on prevention. Am Fam Physician 1999;59(9):2475-2482, 2485.
