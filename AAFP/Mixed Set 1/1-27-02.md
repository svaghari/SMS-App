Reassurance

This child has gastroesophageal reflux. This is a normal physiologic process that occurs in infants. Most reflux events are caused by transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation that is triggered by postprandial gastric distention. This relaxation can continue into childhood, but with growth and an upright eating position it generally improves. Reflux in infants can be treated by implementing body position changes while awake, lower volume feedings if they are overfed, thickening agents, and antiregurgitant formula. It is recommended to avoid the use of medication in infants that have regurgitation that is effortless, painless, and not affecting growth. When the infant is not growing well or appears to be in pain, it would be appropriate to initiate pharmacotherapy with an acid-suppressing medication. Abdominal ultrasonography would be indicated if there were forceful vomiting and concerns about possible pyloric stenosis.
