chronic liver disease

This patient presents with a typical example of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) progressing toward cirrhosis, with multiple risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and mildly elevated hepatic transaminases. Abnormalities of other cell lines would likely occur if a hematologic malignancy or bone marrow failure were present. While immune thrombocytopenic purpura is a diagnostic consideration, it is much less common than NASH and requires other causes to be ruled out. This patient is not taking any medications that have been frequently reported to cause drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
