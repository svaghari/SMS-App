have a bone density test in 2 years

Treatment of adult obesity with bariatric surgery is becoming more common. In addition to counseling patients about surgical options and the risks and benefits of surgery, the family physician is in a position to provide both long-term support and postsurgical medical management. Bariatric surgery does result in greater weight loss than nonsurgical interventions and is highly effective in treating comorbidities of obesity, particularly diabetes mellitus. Bariatric surgery also reduces obesity-related mortality.

After bariatric surgery the patient’s postoperative medications may require adjustments and NSAIDs should be avoided. Patients should be encouraged to eat three meals and one or two snacks daily. Very dry foods, bread, and fibrous vegetables are most likely to cause problems. Fluids should be avoided during meals and for 15–30 minutes before and after meals.

Those desiring pregnancy should wait 12–18 months after surgery. Recommended laboratory studies include a CBC, a metabolic profile, a folic acid level, iron studies, a parathyroid hormone level, a lipid profile, vitamin B12 levels, 24-hour urinary calcium excretion, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. It is recommended that bone density measurements be done every 2 years.
