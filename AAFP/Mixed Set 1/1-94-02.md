Ask the patient to repeat the instructions to you in his own words

To ensure that patients from other cultures understand instructions, it is helpful to ask them to repeat the instructions in their own words. A website would probably not be specific or culturally sensitive to the patientâ€™s condition. The physician should speak in a normal tone to the patient, and not to the interpreter. Family members may be used as convenient translators if necessary, but to maintain confidentiality and reduce miscommunication it is best to use a trained medical interpreter.
