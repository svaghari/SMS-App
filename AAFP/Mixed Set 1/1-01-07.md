Blood cultures

A patient who uses intravenous drugs and has a fever without a clear source must be evaluated for
infectious endocarditis (IE). The first step in this evaluation is to obtain blood cultures. Although this
patient might have a less serious condition, it is critical to evaluate for bacteremia in this situation. If the
concern for IE is high, blood cultures should be obtained and antibiotics may be started while waiting for
results and arranging for urgent echocardiography.
IE in people who inject drugs is more likely to be right-sided, specifically involving the tricuspid valve.
Right-sided IE is less frequently associated with systemic findings of endocarditis such as Janeway lesions
or Roth spots. Patients often do not have a heart murmur.
