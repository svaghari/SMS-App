Adenotonsillectomy

Childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome has a prevalence rate of 5.7%. It is associated with growth, cardiovascular, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. Adenotonsillectomy is the treatment of choice. Although CPAP can be effective, compliance is poor and it is therefore not a first-line treatment. Intranasal corticosteroids may also be helpful, but the benefit appears small.
