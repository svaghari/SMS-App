Drug-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus

Polyuria occurs in 20%–70% of patients on long-term lithium therapy, even when plasma lithium levels
are in the therapeutic range. This is a result of impaired renal concentrating ability that is resistant to
vasopressin (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion causes
hyponatremia and fluid retention. The diuresis associated with diabetes mellitus is a result of the osmotic
effect of increased serum glucose, which is not present in this case. Patients with hypothalamic or pituitary
injuries may develop central diabetes insipidus, which responds to exogenous vasopressin. Psychogenic
water drinking occurs in psychiatric patients, but would not be expected to cause impairment of renal
concentration or hypernatremia.
