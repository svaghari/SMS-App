Fluoxetine (Prozac)

Though symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) overlap with other psychiatric and medical conditions, the case presented is most consistent with GAD. SSRIs are first-line therapy for GAD (SOR B). Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam can improve anxiety-related symptoms, but due to the side effects and addiction potential they are recommended for short-term use (SOR B). Bupropion is approved for the treatment of depression but is not used to treat GAD. Quetiapine may be considered as second-line therapy for GAD (SOR B). Methylphenidate is first-line therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder but is not indicated to treat GAD. Psychotherapy, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy, is also first-line treatment for GAD (SOR A), and exercise can also improve symptoms (SOR B).
