dysthymia

Psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, and dysthymia, are frequently confused with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and must be ruled out before initiating therapy. Symptoms are cyclic in true premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The most accurate way to make the diagnosis is to have the patient carefully record daily symptoms on a menstrual calendar for at least two cycles. Dysthymia consists of a pattern of ongoing, mild depressive symptoms that have been present for at least 2 years and are less severe than those of major depression, which is consistent with the findings in this case.
