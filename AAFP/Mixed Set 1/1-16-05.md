Catheter ablation

Catheter ablation is the most appropriate treatment for a patient with symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome (WPW). Catheter ablation has a very high immediate success rate (96%â€“98%). The most
significant risk associated with the procedure is permanent atrioventricular block, which occurs in
approximately 0.4% of procedures. Adenosine and amiodarone are used for the acute management of
supraventricular tachycardia, but not for long-term management. Node-blocking medications such as
diltiazem and metoprolol should not be used for the long-term treatment of WPW, due to the increased risk
of ventricular fibrillation.
