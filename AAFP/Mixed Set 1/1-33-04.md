A fasting plasma glucose level ≥126 mg/dL on two separate occasions

The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for all asymptomatic adults with a BMI >25.0 kg/m2 who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes mellitus, and screening for all adults with no risk factors every 3 years beginning at age 45. Current criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus include a hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%, a fasting plasma glucose level ≥126 mg/dL, a 2-hour plasma glucose level ≥200 mg/dL, or, in a symptomatic patient, a random blood glucose level ≥200 mg/dL. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, results require confirmation by repeat testing.
