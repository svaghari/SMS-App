Bicarbonate

The diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is based on an elevated serum glucose level (>250 mg/dL),
an elevated serum ketone level, a pH <7.3, and a serum bicarbonate level <18 mEq/L. The severity of
DKA is determined by the arterial pH, bicarbonate level, anion gap, and mental status of the patient.
Elevation of BUN and serum creatinine levels reflects intravascular volume loss. The measured serum
sodium is reduced as a result of the hyperglycemia, as serum sodium is reduced by 1.6 mEq/L for each
100 mg/dL rise in serum glucose. The degree of hyperglycemia does not necessarily correlate closely with
the degree of DKA since a variety of factors determine the level of hyperglycemia, such as oral intake and
urinary glucose loss (SOR C).
