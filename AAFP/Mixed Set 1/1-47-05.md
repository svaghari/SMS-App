CT angiography

CT angiography (CTA) is the recommended imaging procedure for the diagnosis of acute mesenteric vascular disease. The procedure can also identify other possible intra-abdominal causes of pain. Duplex ultrasonography is also accurate, especially for proximal lesions, but can be difficult to perform in patients with obesity, bowel gas, and marked calcification of the vessels, and may be problematic in patients presenting acutely, due to the length of the study and the abdominal pressure required. It is more useful in cases of suspected chronic mesenteric ischemia. Endoscopy is often normal in acute ischemia and may not reach the ischemic section of bowel. MR angiography may be useful, but it takes longer to perform than CTA and lacks the necessary resolution. Catheter angiography is required for endovascular therapies such as thrombolysis or angioplasty with or without stenting, but is usually not performed for making the initial diagnosis in the acute setting.
