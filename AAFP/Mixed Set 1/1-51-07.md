Defibrillation

Pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) should be treated the same as ventricular fibrillation. The first step is defibrillation. If that is unsuccessful, epinephrine is administered and defibrillation is reattempted. Lidocaine, adenosine, and procainamide may be used for the initial treatment of a wide-complex tachycardia of uncertain type, but should not be used for the initial treatment of pulseless VT. Synchronized cardioversion alone would be indicated for the initial treatment of rapid unstable tachycardia with a pulse.
