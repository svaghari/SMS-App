Mupirocin (Bactroban)

This patient has physical findings and a history consistent with impetigo, a skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus pyogenes . Since she has only one lesion, systemic antibiotics are not required as they would be for a patient with extensive disease or multiple lesions. Although bacitracin and neomycin are commonly used, they are much less effective for impetigo than mupirocin, despite some reports of resistance to mupirocin (level A-1 evidence).
