Clostridium difficile colitis

This patient most likely has Clostridium difficile colitis, suggested by semiformed rather than watery stool, fecal leukocytes (not seen in viral gastroenteritis or sprue), and a hospital stay greater than 2 weeks. While this disease has traditionally been associated with antibiotic use, it is posing an increasing threat to patients in hospitals and chronic-care facilities who have not been given antibiotics. The primary sources for infection in such cases have been toilets, bedpans, floors, and the hands of hospital personnel. Prompt recognition and treatment is essential to prevent patient relapse and to minimize intramural epidemics. The diarrhea of ulcerative colitis usually contains blood and occurs intermittently over a protracted course. Digoxin toxicity is likely to be accompanied by electrocardiographic and laboratory abnormalities,
particularly hyper- or hypokalemia.
