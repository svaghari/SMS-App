Graves disease

This patient has symptoms consistent with hyperthyroidism, which could be caused by any of the options
listed. TSH is suppressed and free T4 and free T3 are elevated in all of these conditions. Only Graves
disease, however, will cause high radioactive iodine uptake on a thyroid scan. Uptake will be low in the
other conditions.
