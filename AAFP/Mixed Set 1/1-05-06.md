no weight bearing for a few days, followed by a walking boot, then a rigid-soled shoe in 4–6 weeks

The recommended treatment for metatarsal stress fractures is no weight bearing for a few days, possibly using a posterior splint, transitioning to a walking boot or short leg cast, and then a rigid-soled shoe in 4–6 weeks. Callus formation on a radiograph and a lack of point tenderness signify adequate healing, and immobilization can be discontinued. Other recommended conservative therapy includes modified rest for 6–8 weeks with continuation of activities of daily living and limited walking. Normal activity can be resumed after 2–3 weeks with no pain. Additionally, the use of NSAIDs, ice, and stretching, as well as cross-training is recommended. Resuming regular activity after only 1 week of pain-free rest would not be recommended. Fractures of the fifth metatarsal should be carefully investigated to rule out a Jones fracture that may require orthopedic treatment. Treatment of the more common second and third metatarsal stress fractures is relatively straightforward.
