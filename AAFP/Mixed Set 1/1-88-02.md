Venlafaxine (Effexor)

The abrupt discontinuation of venlafaxine, or a reduction in dosage, is associated with withdrawal symptoms much more severe than those seen with other SSRIs such as fluoxetine. Although more pronounced with higher dosages and prolonged administration, they also occur at lower dosages. These symptoms include agitation, anorexia, confusion, impaired coordination, seizures, sweating, tremor, and vomiting. To avoid this withdrawal symptom, dosage changes should be instituted gradually. Abrupt discontinuation of mood stabilizers such as divalproex, and atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine, can result in the return of psychiatric symptoms, but not severe physiologic dysfunction. Similarly, stopping anticholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil will not cause a withdrawal syndrome. Ref: Drug Facts and Comparisons, 2004 Edition. Facts and Comparisons, 2004, p 1046.
