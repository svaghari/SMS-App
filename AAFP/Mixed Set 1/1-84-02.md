Failure to treat this patient would place her at higher risk of later infertility

It is recommended that sexually active women under the age of 25 years be screened routinely for Chlamydia trachomatis. Treatment of asymptomatic infections in women reduces their risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. A 1-gram dose of oral azithromycin is an appropriate treatment, including during pregnancy. Sexual contacts during the preceding 60 days should be either treated empirically or tested for infection and treated if positive. The patient should avoid sexual intercourse for 7 days after initiation of treatment. Consistent use of barrier methods for contraception reduces the risk of C. trachomatis genital infection.
