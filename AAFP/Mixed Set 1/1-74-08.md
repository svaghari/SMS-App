migraine headache

Migraine is the most likely diagnosis in this scenario, because the patient is young and female; the headaches are unilateral, infrequent, and throbbing; the headaches are associated with nausea and vomiting; and sleep offers relief.  Symptoms of sinusitis usually include fever, facial pain, and a purulent nasal discharge.  The pain of cerebral tumor tends to occur daily and becomes more frequent and severe with time.  Furthermore, the prevalence of brain tumor is far less than that of migraine.  The pain of muscle tension headache is described as a pressure or band-like tightening, often in a circumferential or cap distribution.  This headache also has a pattern of daily persistence, often continuing day and night for long periods of time.  Cluster headache is more common in males, and presents as a very severe, constant, agonizing orbital pain, usually beginning within 2 or 3 hours after falling asleep.
