Polycythemia

Testosterone replacement has significant risks and contraindications. Absolute contraindications include breast cancer, prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level >4 ng/dL, an abnormal rectal examination with nodules, and polycythemia with a hematocrit >54%. Relative contraindications include a baseline hematocrit >50%, a desire for fertility, uncontrolled heart failure, untreated sleep apnea, and severe lower tract symptoms. This patient has polycythemia with a hematocrit >54% and should not be started on testosterone. Testosterone stimulates erythropoiesis and increases the risk of thrombosis. Although there may be an association between testosterone deficiency and coronary artery disease, a history of coronary artery disease is not a contraindication to testosterone replacement. Patients with chronic renal disease who are on chronic opioid therapy are at higher risk of developing secondary testosterone deficiency. Testosterone replacement may increase PSA levels and should not be used in patients with known or suspected prostate cancer.
