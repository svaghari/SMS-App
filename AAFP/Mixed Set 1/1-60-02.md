A culture of midstream voided urine

This patient has clinically diagnosable acute bacterial prostatitis, and no further testing, including imaging, is required to establish the diagnosis. Culture of a midstream voided urine may aid in identifying the pathogen, but prostate massage should be avoided because it may increase the risk of bacteremia. A prostate biopsy is not indicated in the presence of acute infection, and a prostate-specific antigen level is not indicated because it is likely to be elevated in the presence of infection.
