Consultation for surgery

This patientâ€™s cat is well more than 10 days after the bite, so rabies vaccine is not necessary. Azithromycin is indicated for cat scratch disease, but the presentation does not suggest this. Severe infections may require incision, drainage, and intravenous antibiotics. A surgery consultation is recommended to evaluate for tendon sheath or joint infection.
