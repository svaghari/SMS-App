A spiral CT scan of the abdomen

A retrospective review of 650 patients with suspected appendicitis showed a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 98% for spiral CT. In patients in whom the clinical diagnosis was uncertain, sensitivity was 92% and specificity was 85%. Two prospective studies comparing ultrasonography with spiral CT have favored spiral CT. Ultrasonography is used in women who are pregnant and women in whom there is a high degree of suspicion of gynecologic disease. Abdominal radiography has low specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Air contrast barium enema also has low accuracy. Limitations of MRI include increased cost, decreased availability, and increased examination time compared to CT. Ref: Paulson EK, Kalady MF, Pappas TN: Suspected appendicitis.
