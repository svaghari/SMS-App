Ezetimibe/simvastatin (Vytorin)

High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for patients younger than 75 years of age with known
coronary artery disease. For those who are intolerant of high-intensity statins, a trial of a
moderate-intensity statin is appropriate. There is evidence to support ezetimibe plus a statin in patients with
acute coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease. Omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates, and niacin should not
be prescribed for primary or secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease because they
do not affect patient-oriented outcomes. PCSK9 inhibitors such as evolocumab are injectable monoclonal
antibodies that lower LDL-cholesterol levels significantly and have produced some promising results, but
more studies are needed to determine when this would be cost effective.
