Aortic stenosis

Syncope with exercise is a manifestation of organic heart disease in which cardiac output is fixed and does not rise (or even fall) with exertion. Syncope, commonly on exertion, is reported in up to 42% of patients with severe aortic stenosis. Vasovagal syncope is associated with unpleasant stimuli or physiologic conditions, including sights, sounds, smells, sudden pain, sustained upright posture, heat, hunger, and acute blood loss. Transient ischemic attacks are not related to exertion. Orthostatic hypotension is associated with changing from a sitting or lying position to an upright position. Atrial myxoma is associated with syncope related to changes in position, such as bending, lying down from a seated position, or turning over in bed.
