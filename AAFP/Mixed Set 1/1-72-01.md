worsen existing urinary obstruction

Sympathomimetic agents can elevate blood pressure and intraocular pressure, may worsen existing urinary obstruction, and adversely interact with  -blockers, methyldopa, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral hypoglycemic agents and MAOIs. They also speed up the heart rate. First-generation nonprescription antihistamines can enhance the anticholinergic and sedative effects of other medications.
