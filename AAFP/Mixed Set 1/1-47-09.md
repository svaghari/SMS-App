Observation only

Uterine fibroid tumors (leiomyomas) are the most common tumors of the female reproductive tract, with some evidence suggesting that the cumulative incidence in women age 25â€“45 years is approximately 30%. Symptoms related to fibroids can include menorrhagia, pelvic pain, obstructive symptoms, infertility, or pregnancy loss. However, many fibroids are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally, with observation being the preferred management in this situation (SOR B). The risk of malignant leiomyosarcoma is exceedingly small (0.23% in one study) and there is a risk of side effects or complications from other treatment modalities.

For women who are symptomatic, the data is insufficient regarding the most appropriate therapy. Surgical options include myomectomy, hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization, and myolysis, but data to allow direct comparison is lacking. With the exception of trials of GnRH-agonist therapy as an adjunct to surgery, there is not enough randomized trial data to support the use of medical therapies such as oral contraceptives, NSAIDs, or progestins in the treatment of symptomatic fibroids.
