endoscopy

Solid but not liquid dysphagia suggests a structural lesion. A location in the chest indicates esophageal dysphagia. Endoscopy is the single most useful test for esophageal dysphagia and can visualize mucosal lesions better than barium radiography. Therapy can also be performed during the procedure. A fluoroscopic swallowing study would be indicated if the patient’s history pointed to oral or pharyngeal dysphagia. Even if it is thought that the dysphagia is caused by a motility disorder, endoscopy is still preferred, because neoplastic and inflammatory conditions can produce spasm and motility symptoms. Manometry can be performed if endoscopy does not adequately explain the symptoms.
