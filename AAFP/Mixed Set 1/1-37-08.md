CT angiography

CT angiography (CTA) is the recommended imaging modality for the diagnosis of visceral ischemic syndromes because of its 95%â€“100% accuracy. Images of the origins and length of the vessels can be obtained rapidly, characterize the extent of stenosis or occlusion and the relationship to branch vessels, and aid in the assessment of options for revascularization. Endoscopy is most useful for diagnosing conditions other than mesenteric ischemia. The value of ultrasonography is extremely dependent on the skills of the technologist. In addition, adequate imaging can be difficult to obtain in patients with obesity, bowel gas, and heavy calcification in the vessels. Angiography with selective catheterization of mesenteric vessels is now used after a plan for revascularization has been chosen. MR angiography takes longer to perform than CTA, lacks the necessary resolution, and can overestimate the degree of stenosis.
