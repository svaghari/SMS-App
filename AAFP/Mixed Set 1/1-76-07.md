Aspirin and heparin combined

Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, fetal loss, thrombocytopenia, and poor pregnancy outcome. Studies comparing aspirin alone versus aspirin and heparin suggest that the combination of aspirin and heparin is most effective for decreasing fetal loss. One study showed decreased fetal loss with a combination of corticosteroids and aspirin, but the results have not been reproduced in subsequent studies. In addition, the use of prednisone was associated with an increased risk of premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, infection, preeclampsia, diabetes, osteopenia, and avascular necrosis. Progesterone may be useful for recurrent spontaneous abortion related to a luteal phase defect, but has not been shown to be effective in preventing complications associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
