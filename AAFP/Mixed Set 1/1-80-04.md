NRT usually doubles a smokers chance of quitting

A Cochrane meta-analysis of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) found that it almost doubles a smokers chances of quitting (SOR A).  There was no benefit to tapering NRT as compared to abrupt discontinuation.  Treatment for 8 weeks was as effective as a longer course.  No one type of NRT is significantly more effective, but combining several types may aid a relapsed smoker in his or her next quit attempt.
