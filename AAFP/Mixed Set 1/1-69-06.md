Quetiapine (Seroquel)

Bipolar disorders often present in late childhood or early adolescence. Outcomes can be improved by early recognition. Manic episodes that occur with bipolar I disorder are usually easy to identify. However, patients with bipolar II disorder may have a hypomanic episode that goes unrecognized, and the patient may present with persistent depression. There is usually a family history of bipolar disorder or multiple relatives having persistent depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit disorder, or panic disorder. There may be multiple instances in the family of suicide, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, or incarceration. The patient has likely failed to respond to at least three antidepressant drugs and may have a history of multiple divorces.

There are options for the treatment of bipolar depression. Quetiapine usually leads to a response after 1 week of therapy but is associated with weight gain and extrapyramidal side effects. Olanzapine may also be used but should be combined with an SSRI. Lithium may also be effective for acute depression. Lamotrigine is effective but titration should be spread over at least 6 weeks in order to decrease the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
