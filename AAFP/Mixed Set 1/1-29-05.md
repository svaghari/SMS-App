Thyroid cancer

GLP-1 agonists are contraindicated in patients with medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasm syndrome, or with a family history of these conditions. They are not associated with heart failure, coronary artery disease, or hypothyroidism. They have been associated with pancreatitis in rare cases, but this is not a contraindication to prescribing them.
