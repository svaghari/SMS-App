Initiating treatment based on her calculated risk of a cardiovascular event in the next 10 years

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline suggests statin therapy for individuals with an estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease of 7.5% or greater. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend statin therapy when the patientâ€™s 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease is 10% or greater. While international guidelines differ somewhat, other major guidelines would support similar recommendations.
