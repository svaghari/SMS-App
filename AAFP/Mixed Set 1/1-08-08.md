Reduction of visual acuity

Reduced visual acuity may be a symptom of acute angle-closure glaucoma and requires immediate referral
to an ophthalmologist. Copious mucopurulent drainage from the eye is a sign of infectious conjunctivitis,
most likely bacterial, and bilateral eye redness is typically seen with allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic or
infectious conjunctivitis and small corneal abrasions can be managed by the family physician. Bright red
blood under the conjunctiva is consistent with a subconjunctival hemorrhage that will typically resolve
without intervention.
