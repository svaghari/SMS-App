An ACE inhibitor

The panel members of the Eighth Joint National Committee for the management of blood pressure recommended that ACE inhibitors should be initiated for renal protection in adults with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and microalbuminuria. This patient appears to be in an early stage of nephropathy, and ACE inhibitors will reduce the decline in renal function. Î²-Blockers are no longer recommended for first-line treatment. In white patients who do not have diabetes, therapy may be started with ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or calcium channel blockers.
