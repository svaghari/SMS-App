Observation only

Molluscum contagiosum is a common disease during childhood, but can also occur in adolescents and adults. It is caused by a poxvirus and is characterized by flesh-colored, dome-shaped papules with central umbilication, most commonly on the trunk, axilla, popliteal or antecubital fossae, and crural folds. If lesions are asymptomatic and not inflamed, the initial treatment is observation, with most lesions resolving spontaneously within 2â€“12 months. If the lesions are inflamed or pruritic, then topical corticosteroid treatment, chemical treatment with cantharidin, podofilox 0.5% solution, curettage, or cryotherapy may be indicated.

Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is initially treated with emollients and by avoiding frequent hot baths. Verruca (warts) are commonly treated with paring, followed by topical salicylic acid or cryotherapy. Antifungal cream would not be appropriate.
