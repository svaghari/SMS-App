A 48-year-old with a BMI of 42 and no other health problems

The 1991 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel recommended that surgical treatment of severe obesity be considered for any patient with a BMI >40 or those with a BMI >35 who have serious coexisting medical problems. Examples of such coexisting medical problems include severe sleep apnea, Pickwickian syndrome, obesity-related cardiomyopathy, and severe diabetes mellitus.
