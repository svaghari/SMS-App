Rosuvastatin (Crestor), 20 mg daily

Patients <75 years of age with established coronary artery disease should be on high-intensity statin regimens if tolerated. These regimens include atorvastatin, 40â€“80 mg/day, and rosuvastatin, 20â€“40 mg/day. Moderate-intensity regimens include simvastatin, 40 mg/day. Monotherapy with non-statin medications (bile acid sequestrants, niacin, ezetimibe, and fibrates) does not reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. The PCSK9 inhibitors evolocumab and alirocumab are second-line or add-on therapies at this time.
