Doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 10 days

This patient has early Lyme disease as evidenced by erythema migrans, fever, myalgias, and arthralgias.
The treatment of early Lyme disease is doxycycline for 7–21 days. Single-dose doxycycline is used for
prophylaxis to prevent Lyme disease after a tick bite in an area where Lyme disease is endemic. Longer
treatment periods are required for Lyme arthritis and patients may require intravenous antibiotics. With
this patient’s clinical presentation, antibiotic treatment would be recommended and serologic testing is not
needed. In clinical scenarios where diagnostic testing is needed, testing for early Lyme disease should be
performed with a two-tier test starting with an enzyme immunoassay and, if positive, confirmed with a
Western blot.
