Prepubescent testicular size

Most cases of short stature are due to constitutional growth delay, a term which implies that the child is normal but delayed in his development. A hallmark of this condition is being below the fifth percentile for height for most of childhood. Usually these children are thin and have a family history of delayed development. Bone age would be expected to be at least 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for agematched peers of the same chronologic age. However, most experts agree that if no signs of puberty are seen by 14 years of age (no breast development in girls, no testicular enlargement in boys), then further workup for a more serious condition should be sought. Other indications for evaluation would be no menarche in a girl by 16 years of age and underdeveloped genitalia in a boy 5 years after his first pubertal changes.
