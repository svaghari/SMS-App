Supraclavicular

In patients with head and neck lymphadenopathy, supraclavicular nodes are the most likely to be malignant. Lymphadenopathy of these nodes should always be investigated, even in children. Overall, the prevalence of malignancy with this presentation is unknown, but rates of 54%â€“85% have been seen in biopsy series reports. Ref: Bazemore AW, Smucker DR: Lymphadenopathy and malignancy.
