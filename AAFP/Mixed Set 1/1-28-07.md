Motivational interviewing to explore the patientâ€™s desire, ability, reason, and need to make a change

Difficult patient encounters involve many factors including both patient and clinician characteristics, behaviors, feelings, and attitudes. Motivational interviewing has been shown to improve the therapeutic alliance and result in positive behavior change. Clinicians may need to adjust schedules to allow appropriate time with such patients, but judgmental or dismissive remarks are not productive.
