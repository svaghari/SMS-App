A spot protein/creatinine ratio performed on first morning urine

It is important to distinguish serious illness from benign causes of proteinuria, which are the most common etiology in children. Confirming the presence of proteinuria is the next step in this case because functional (exercise/stress-induced) and orthostatic proteinuria are common types of proteinuria and are transient. A 24-hour urine for protein is a possible option, but would be impractical and burdensome for a healthy-acting 11-year-old. The pediatric nephrology panel of the National Kidney Foundation reported that a spot protein/creatinine ratio is a reliable test for ruling out proteinuria. A specialist referral, blood analysis, and ultrasonography are unnecessary unless persistent proteinuria is identified.
