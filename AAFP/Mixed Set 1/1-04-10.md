An inhaled corticosteroid

Pediatric asthma is the most commonly encountered chronic illness, occurring in nearly one out of seven individuals. Short-acting β-agonists in the form of metered-dose inhalers are clearly favored for acute exacerbations, as well as for intermittent asthma. Treatment for persistent asthma requires the use of inhaled corticosteroids, with short-acting β-agonists used for exacerbations. For patients not well controlled with those options, either a long-acting β-agonist or a leukotriene receptor antagonist may be added. While both cromolyn and nedocromil are fairly devoid of adverse effects, their use is limited because of a lack of efficacy in the prevention of acute asthma exacerbations.
