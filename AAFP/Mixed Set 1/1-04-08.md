Escitalopram (Lexapro)

Social anxiety disorder can be treated with psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. Several medications have been used for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. SSRIs are considered to be the first-line pharmacologic treatment. Response rates reported for the SNRI venlafaxine have been similar to those reported for SSRIs. Randomized trials have also supported the efficacy of benzodiazepines for social anxiety disorder, but they carry a risk of physiologic dependence and withdrawal symptoms and are not recommended for patients with coexisting depression or a history of substance abuse. Response rates to pregabalin have been lower than with SSRIs. Tricyclic antidepressants and bupropion are not considered to be useful in the treatment of social anxiety disorder.
