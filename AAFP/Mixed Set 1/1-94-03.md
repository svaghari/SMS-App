An annular rash with a bright red outer border and partial central clearing

An annular rash with a bright red outer border and partial central clearing is characteristic of erythema migrans. It is important to remember that not all lesions associated with Lyme disease look this way, and that some patients with Lyme disease may not have any skin lesions at all. Rocky Mountain spotted fever causes scattered individual purple macules on the ankles and wrists. A dry, scaling, dark red rash in the groin, with an active border and central clearing, is seen with tinea cruris. A diffuse eruption with clear vesicles surrounded by reddish macules is found in chickenpox. A migratory pruritic, erythematous, papular eruption is most consistent with urticaria.
