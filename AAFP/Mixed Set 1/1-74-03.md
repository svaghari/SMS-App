Twice-daily use of ibuprofen for 2 weeks

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is often drug-induced.  Discontinuation of medications that are likely to cause AIN is the most important first step in management.  If these medications are withdrawn early, most patients can be expected to recover normal renal function.  Of the medications listed, ibuprofen is the most likely offending agent, because all NSAIDs are known to be associated with AIN.  Development of AIN usually becomes evident approximately 2 weeks after starting a medication and is not dose-related.  Other medications strongly associated with AIN include various antibiotics (particularly cephalosporins, penicillins, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, and rifampin), diuretics, and miscellaneous medications such as allopurinol.
