Eccentric calf-strengthening exercises

Achilles tendinopathy is among the most common injuries in middle-aged distance runners. Oral NSAIDs may be helpful for temporary pain relief, but they contribute little to recovery from this injury. Corticosteroid injection is contraindicated due to the risk of tendon rupture. Surgical debridement and fixation in a walking boot may be considered as a last resort for difficult cases, but the most effective treatment overall is eccentric calf-strengthening exercises.
