Referral for surgical release of the contracture

ANSWER: E
This patient has Dupuytren’s disease with a contracture of the affected finger. Surgical release is indicated
when the metacarpophalangeal joint contracture reaches 30° or with any degree of contracture of the
proximal interphalangeal joint. Intralesional injection may reduce the need for later surgery in a patient
with grade 1 disease, but not if there is a contracture. There is no evidence to support the use of physical
therapy or cryosurgery.
