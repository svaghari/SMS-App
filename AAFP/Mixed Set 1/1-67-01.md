Cognitive therapy

This patient is engaged in cognitive therapy, which is a treatment process that helps patients correct false self-beliefs that can lead to negative moods and behaviors. Cognitive therapy has been shown to effectively treat patients with unipolar major depression, and is particularly useful in patients who do not respond to medication or who prefer nonpharmacologic therapy.
Psychoanalysis is a process of free association where repressed memories are recovered. Biofeedback involves instrumentation that gives feedback about a patient’s physiologic response to various situations in order to bring the autonomic nervous system under voluntary control. Group psychotherapy is a form of treatment in which people who are emotionally ill meet in a group guided by a trained therapist and help one another effect personality change. Hypnosis involves helping a patient enter a state of heightened focal concentration and receptivity that is typified by a feeling of involuntariness or an altered state of consciousness.
