Sacroiliac joint dysfunction

The cause of hip pain is generally determined from the patientâ€™s history and physical examination. A
positive flexion, abduction, external rotation (FABER) test that produces pain at the sacroiliac joint, lumbar
spine, and posterior hip is associated with sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The log roll test involves passive
supine internal and external rotation of the hip. When this test is positive for pain it is associated with
piriformis syndrome. While femoroacetabular impingement may be associated with a positive FABER test,
it would produce pain in the groin. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome results in lateral hip pain rather
than posterior pain. Osteoarthritis is usually associated with a limited range of motion and groin pain.
