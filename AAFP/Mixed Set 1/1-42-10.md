Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography

Individuals with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for vascular disease, especially stroke. All sickle cell patients 2â€“16 years of age should be screened with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (SOR A). A chest radiograph, abdominal ultrasonography, a DXA scan, and renal Doppler ultrasonography are not recommended for screening patients with sickle cell disease.
