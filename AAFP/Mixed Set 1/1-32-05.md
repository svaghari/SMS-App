Leaving the indwelling catheter in place for 48–72 hours

This patient is suffering from acute urinary retention, likely due to mild benign prostatic hyperplasia exacerbated by pain medication and a lack of activity. Acute urinary retention could also possibly be due to irritation of sympathetic and/or parasympathetic nerves near the spine. Placing an indwelling bladder catheter is appropriate. It would also be reasonable, although impractical in the short term, to teach the patient or his caretakers to intermittently catheterize him.

The likelihood of a successful return to voiding spontaneously will increase over time. However, the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infection is estimated to be about 5% per day. Therefore, catheter removal and a trial of spontaneous voiding should be attempted after 48–72 hours. There is good evidence that starting an α-blocking medication such as tamsulosin during the time the catheter is in place will nearly double the success of the trial of spontaneous voiding. Finasteride in isolation is not recommended and oxybutynin would be contraindicated.
