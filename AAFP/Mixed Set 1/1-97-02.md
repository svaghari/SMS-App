A regular diet

This patient should be provided with a regular diet, which may promote weight gain in nursing-home residents with unintentional weight loss. Malnutrition and unintentional weight loss are significant problems in nursing-home residents and lead to multiple complications, including pressure ulcers and infections. The American Dietetic Association recommends liberalizing diets to improve nutritional status and quality of life in older adults. A small study demonstrated equivalent glycemic control in nursing-home residents who ate a regular diet compared to those who ate a restricted American Diabetes Association diet (SOR C). Low-salt and low-cholesterol diets are unpalatable and are often associated with protein-energy malnutrition and postural hypotension in older persons. Special diets should be avoided whenever possible in nursing-home patients.
