Herpes simplex virus is a likely cause

Herpes simplex virus is the most common etiologic agent of erythema multiforme. Other infections, particularly Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections and fungal infections, may also be associated with this hypersensitivity reaction. Other causes include medications and vaccines. Skin biopsy findings are not specific for erythema multiforme. As opposed to the lesions of urticaria, the lesions of erythema multiforme usually are present and fixed for at least 1 week and may evolve into target lesions. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet may be involved. The lesions of erythema multiforme usually resolve spontaneously over 3â€“5 weeks without sequelae.
