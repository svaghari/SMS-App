Referral to a surgeon for consideration of parathyroidectomy

Hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by a single adenoma of one of the four parathyroid glands. A minority of cases (10%–15%) are associated with four-gland hyperplasia. Studies that localize the glands, such as a technetium scan or ultrasonography, help surgeons who are familiar with this condition achieve a cure rate of 95%–98%, with an estimated complication rate of 1%–3%. For patients <50 years old or symptomatic patients, such as those with a fragility fracture, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. If a patient is older, is a poor surgical candidate, or has asymptomatic disease, long-term monitoring with treatment focused on reducing bony complications can be considered (SOR C).
