Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody

Rheumatoid arthritis is primarily a clinical diagnosis and no single laboratory test is considered definitively diagnostic. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody is recommended by rheumatologists to improve the specificity of testing for rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-CCP is more specific than rheumatoid factor, and may predict erosive disease more accurately. Antinuclear antibody has limited usefulness for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-Sm antibody is useful to help diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus. Nonspecific changes in complement levels are seen in many rheumatologic disorders. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is useful in monitoring disease activity and the course of rheumatoid arthritis, but is not specific.
