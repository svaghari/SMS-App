Exertional dyspnea

When symptoms begin to appear in a patient with aortic stenosis the prognosis worsens. It is therefore
important to be aware of systolic murmurs in older patients presenting with exertional dyspnea, chest pain,
or dizziness. This can be the first presentation of a downward spiral and the need for rapid valve
replacement. Weight loss, frequent urination, jaundice, and worsening headache are not as closely
associated with a generally worse outlook for patients with aortic stenosis.
