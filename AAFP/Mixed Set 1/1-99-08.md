35 days

For patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends outpatient thromboprophylaxis for a duration of up to 35 days. Older recommendations for 10â€“14 days of prophylaxis were based on studies performed when this was the usual hospital stay. This is still recommended as the minimum length for prophylaxis, but a longer period of time is preferred.
