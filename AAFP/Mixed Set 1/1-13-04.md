Acetazolamide (Diamox Sequels)

Acetazolamide is the preferred agent for preventing acute mountain sickness (AMS). Multiple trials have
demonstrated its efficacy in preventing AMS. Dexamethasone is a first-line treatment for acute mountain
sickness of any severity but is a second-line drug for prevention because of its side-effect profile. Tadalafil
is advised as a second-line treatment after nifedipine for the prevention and treatment of high-altitude
pulmonary edema. Zolpidem may help with sleep but not AMS, and aspirin is not recommended for
prevention of AMS.
