Intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone (Rocephin)

Infantile gonococcal infection is usually the result of exposure to infected cervical exudate during delivery and manifests 2–5 days after birth. Ophthalmia neonatorum and sepsis are the most severe gonococcal infections in newborns and immediate treatment is warranted based on the presumptive diagnosis. Topical antibiotics are appropriate for prophylaxis, but not for treatment. Silver was used for prophylaxis at one time, but is no longer available. Povidone-iodine has not been studied for prevention. A single dose of 25–50 mg/kg of ceftriaxone administered intravenously or intramuscularly is the recommended treatment.
