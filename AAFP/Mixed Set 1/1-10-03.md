Echocardiography

According to national guidelines echocardiography is the preferred initial noninvasive testing modality
when pulmonary hypertension is suspected (SOR C). Pulmonary function tests provide helpful information
in regard to pulmonary capacity but are not necessarily diagnostic of pulmonary hypertension. CT of the
chest with contrast will not provide pulmonary pressures but may assist in the detection of pulmonary
emboli. A coronary calcium scan may be indicated to evaluate for coronary artery disease but it is not a
diagnostic test for pulmonary hypertension. Although right heart catheterization would provide pulmonary
pressure values it is considered more invasive than echocardiography and is not always necessary for
making the diagnosis.
