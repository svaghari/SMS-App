Fifth grade

It is recommended that all printed patient education information be written at or below a fifth- to
sixth-grade reading level. This aligns with universal health literacy precautions in which easy-to-understand
concepts and terms are used for all patients instead of focusing on those with low literacy. These literacy
precautions are recommended by professional organizations such as the American Medical Association and
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
