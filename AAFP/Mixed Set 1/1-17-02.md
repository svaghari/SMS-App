Written self-management plans that include smoking cessation plans

Written self-management plans have been shown to decrease respiratory-related hospitalizations in patients
with COPD. Although regular physical activity has clear health benefits, the methods are so varied in
studies of physical activity that there is currently no strong evidence to show it reduces hospitalizations in
COPD patients. Although FEV1 is important for predicting hospitalizations for a population, it is not
accurate enough to be useful in an individual patient. Daily oxygen therapy does not help to postpone the
first hospitalization. Nightly CPAP therapy reduces hospitalizations in patients with COPD and sleep
apnea, but not those with COPD alone.
