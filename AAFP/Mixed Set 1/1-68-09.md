Referral to an ophthalmologist

This patient likely has herpes zoster ophthalmicus. In addition to treatment with a systemic antiviral agent, it is important that the patient see an ophthalmologist to be evaluated for corneal disease and iritis, as vision can be lost. This is a viral infection, so corticosteroids could worsen the infection. Mupirocin or metronidazole would not resolve the infection.
