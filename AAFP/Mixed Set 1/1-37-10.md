Fluoxetine (Prozac)

Expert panel guideline recommendations suggest fluoxetine should be the first-line pharmacotherapy option for adolescents after a trial of psychotherapy. The patient should be monitored weekly for side effects for a month after starting fluoxetine. If fluoxetine is ineffective, sertraline and citalopram are recommended as alternatives. Venlafaxine should be avoided in adolescents because it is associated with a statistically increased risk of suicidal behavior or ideation.
