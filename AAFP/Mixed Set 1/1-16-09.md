Topical 20% aluminum chloride (Drysol)

The recommended first-line treatment for primary focal hyperhidrosis is topical 20% aluminum chloride.
It should be applied to affected areas nightly for 6â€“8 hours and works by obstructing the eccrine sweat
glands and destroying secretory cells. Iontophoresis and botulinum toxin are alternative first- or second-line
therapies for palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis and hyperhidrosis affecting the axillae, palms, soles, or
face.
Topical 2% glycopyrrolate must be compounded by a pharmacy and is indicated only for craniofacial
hyperhidrosis. Oral anticholinergics such as oxybutynin can be considered if other first-line treatments fail.
However, up to 10% of patients will stop taking these medications due to side effects such as dry mouth,
constipation, urinary retention, and blurred vision. Microwave technology is a newer treatment option that
has shown some promising results but should not be recommended as a first-line treatment. Sympathetic
denervation should be used only if other less invasive therapies have already been tried.
