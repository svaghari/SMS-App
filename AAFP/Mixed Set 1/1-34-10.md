Macules over the extensor surfaces of her joints

This patient’s symptoms and findings suggest dermatomyositis. This disease is distinguished from autoimmune myopathies and polymyositis by distinct dermatologic findings, including Gottron’s sign (nonpalpable macules over the extensor surface of joints). Patients may also have dilated nail-fold capillaries and ragged, thickened cuticles. Distal onycholysis is most commonly associated with onychomycosis, while hyperkeratotic plaques are not a feature of dermatomyositis. Polygonal papules on the wrist flexor surfaces are seen in lichen planus.
