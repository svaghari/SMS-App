Doxycycline for 14 days

Early systemic Lyme disease may manifest with facial nerve palsy, and treatment should include corticosteroids. The evidence for efficacy of antivirals for facial nerve palsy is lacking, especially beyond 3â€“4 days after onset. But in this case, specific treatment to eradicate the Lyme disease is also indicated, in order to prevent later, more severe systemic complications.

For facial nerve palsy, treatment with doxycycline or amoxicillin for 14 days is effective. Patients with more severe neurologic manifestations of Lyme disease, such as altered mental status, meningoencephalitis, or other cranial nerve palsies, require longer courses of antibiotics, usually intravenously.

A single-dose treatment with doxycycline or amoxicillin is recommended as prophylaxis in asymptomatic patients after a known tick bite. This is only recommended for tick attachment longer than 36 hours, or of unknown duration.
