Low 24-hour urine calcium

Low urine 24-hour calcium levels or a low urine calcium to urine creatinine ratio is not characteristic of hyperparathyroidism. This finding should suggest familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (SOR C). Awareness of this condition is important to avoid unnecessary surgery. The parathyroid hormone level may be mildly elevated. Parathyroid hormone is elevated in hyperparathyroidism. Serum chloride tends to be high normal or mildly elevated. Alkaline phosphatase may be elevated in more severe cases, while serum phosphate levels tend to be low.
