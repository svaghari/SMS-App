20%

The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends pharmacologic treatment when a DXA scan reveals a T-score –2.5 (the cutoff for a diagnosis of osteoporosis), or when the T-score falls between –1.0 and –2.5 (the diagnosis criterion for osteopenia) and the 10-year risk of a major fracture reaches 20%. The T-score of –2.0 places this patient in the “osteopenic” range. A 10-year probability of a hip fracture 3% is also an indication for treatment.
