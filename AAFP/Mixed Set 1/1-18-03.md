RBC casts

This is a classic presentation for acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), with the onset of
gross hematuria associated with hypertension and systemic edema. This is most commonly seen in
school-age children, usually 1–2 weeks after an episode of pharyngitis or 3–4 weeks after an episode of
impetigo, caused by so-called nephritogenic strains of Group A -hemolytic Streptococcus. The hematuria
is caused by immune complex–mediated glomerular injury.

Bacteriuria may be seen in both upper and lower urinary tract infections, but may also be a spurious
finding, especially with the combined presence of epithelial cells. The classic finding on microscopic
urinalysis for acute glomerulonephritis is the presence of RBC casts. WBC casts are seen with acute
pyelonephritis. The presence of urinary eosinophils indicates acute interstitial nephritis. Calcium oxalate
makes up the most common type of kidney stones.
Antibiotics prescribed for antecedent pharyngitis do not prevent APSGN. Treatment is supportive,
controlling blood pressure and edema with a thiazide or a loop diuretic. The prognosis for resolution and
full recovery of the vast majority of patients with APSGN is excellent, especially in the pediatric age
group.
