Ocular

Sarcoidosis has numerous extrapulmonary manifestations. Because inflammation of the eye can result in
permanent impairment and is often asymptomatic, patients require yearly eye examinations as well as
additional monitoring with disease flares. Although skin involvement is common it is usually readily
apparent and rarely has serious sequelae. Cardiac sarcoidosis can potentially lead to progressive heart
failure and sudden death, but evaluation is needed only in patients who are symptomatic. Similarly,
evaluation for neurologic involvement is needed only in patients who are symptomatic.
