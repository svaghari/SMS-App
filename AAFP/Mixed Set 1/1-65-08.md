Treatment with alendronate (Fosamax)

Of the options listed, treatment with bisphosphonates to prevent osteoporotic hip and vertebral fractures
is the only one supported by consistent patient-oriented, high-quality clinical evidence (SOR A). While
each of the other recommendations has merit, the overall level of evidence for effectiveness is less
compelling for these treatments than for treatment with bisphosphonates (SOR B).
