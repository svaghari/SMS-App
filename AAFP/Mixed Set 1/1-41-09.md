A reticulocyte count in 1–2 weeks

The reticulocyte count is the first and best indicator of iron absorption and bone marrow response to oral iron therapy in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia. An increase in reticulocytes is seen as early as 4 days, peaking at 7–10 days. The rate of production of new RBCs slows thereafter due to a compensatory decrease in erythropoietin as more iron becomes available. It typically takes 4–6 weeks before seeing recovery in the hematocrit, and for the RBC count and indices to normalize. However it is usually 4–6 months before iron stores are fully restored to normal levels, so treatment should continue for at least that long.
