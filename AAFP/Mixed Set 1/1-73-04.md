Kava

The use of herbal and nutritional supplements has become commonplace in the United States.  Unfortunately, there is insufficient research for most herbal remedies, in terms of both efficacy and safety.  However, there is a significant body of evidence from randomized, controlled trials and various meta-analyses showing benefit from the use of kava in the short-term treatment of anxiety disorders (up to 24 weeks), including generalized anxiety disorder (SOR A).  The other remedies listed have only single studies or anecdotal evidence attesting to benefit for patients with anxiety.  At best, information about them is limited, and there are often conflicting results. Safety concerns about kava have been addressed by recent randomized, controlled trials demonstrating that kava has a safety profile similar to those of FDA-approved treatments for anxiety disorders.  Care should be taken with any concurrent use of kava and medications metabolized by the liver, and patients should be discouraged from using alcohol while taking kava. Physicians should be aware of all remedies their patients are taking, even if they are not prescribed.  In addition, it is important to be aware of remedies that have evidence supporting their use.
