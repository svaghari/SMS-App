A therapeutic trial of iron for 1 month

It is important to screen for anemia during late infancy. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in this age group. There is evidence that persistent iron deficiency in childhood may have a negative impact on cognitive development. A therapeutic trial of iron is the best approach to the treatment of iron deficiency in late infancy. If the anemia fails to respond, investigating other causes of anemia is indicated.
