Maintain neutrality and avoid triangulation

When family dynamics lead to conflict during an office visit, it is best for the physician to attempt to remain neutral by avoiding triangulation, which occurs when the two sides in conflict each attempt to align with a third party. Priority should be given to the patient’s right to privacy and confidentiality, and the physician should ask permission from the patient to discuss his or her health issues with other people. Physicians should always remember who they are primarily responsible to.
