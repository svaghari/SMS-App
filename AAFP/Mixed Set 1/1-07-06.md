Addressing the patient directly when speaking

When professional interpreters participate in patient care it is important to speak directly in the first person,
using “I” statements rather than statements that start with “tell her” (SOR C). It is ideal to seat the
interpreter next to or slightly behind the patient, so that the patient is the focus of the interaction.
Sentence-by-sentence interpretation can prevent miscommunication errors, as opposed to expecting the
interpreter to remember every detail of a complex care plan. It is not appropriate for the medical
interpreter to also serve as a witness to consent. Focusing on three or fewer key points rather than
over-communicating multiple complex issues increases the likelihood that the patient will comprehend the
plan of care.
