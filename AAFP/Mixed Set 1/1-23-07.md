Continuous nasogastric enteral nutrition

The American College of Gastroenterology recommends that patients with severe acute pancreatitis receive enteral nutrition. Enteral feedings help prevent infectious complications, such as infected necrosis, by maintaining the gut mucosal barrier and preventing translocation of bacteria that may seed pancreatic necrosis. Currently, continuous enteral feeding is preferred over bolus feeding. A meta-analysis has shown that continuous nasogastric enteral feeding started in the first 48 hours decreases mortality and the length of hospital stay.

Total parenteral nutrition is not recommended because of infectious and line-related complications. It should be avoided unless the enteral route cannot be used.
