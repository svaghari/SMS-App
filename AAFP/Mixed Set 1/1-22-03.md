An IUD

Family physicians are often asked to provide primary care for organ transplant recipients. Pregnancy should be avoided during the 12 months following transplantation because of
the increased risk of preterm delivery and graft rejection. Female fertility typically increases post transplant. The use of an IUD avoids interactions with medications, does not increase the risk of infection, and is not affected by typical immunosuppressive therapies.

The remaining options are incorrect because of their higher failure and discontinuation rates. The CDC cites failure rates with typical use of 9% for combined oral contraceptives and the etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring, 6% for injectable progesterone, 0.2% for levonorgestrel IUDs, and 0.08% for the copper IUD. Barrier method failure rates exceed 18%. Combined oral contraceptives and the vaginal ring also have potential estrogen-related side effects, and injectable progesterone use increases the risk for osteoporosis.
