Ceftriaxone (Rocephin)

The most common pathogen for nonpurulent cellulitis is Î²-hemolytic streptococci. Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend treating moderate nonpurulent cellulitis with penicillin, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, or clindamycin alone. Vancomycin would be indicated if the patient had a history of illicit drug use, purulent drainage, concurrent evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, or severe cellulitis.
