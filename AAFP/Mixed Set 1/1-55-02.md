Escherichia coli

Newborns with sepsis may have focal signs of infection such as pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome, but they also may have nonfocal signs and symptoms. In the newborn period the two most common causes of neonatal sepsis are group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. Listeria monocytogenes was once a more common cause but it is now uncommon. Streptococcal pneumonia is an uncommon cause of sepsis in neonates. Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus are not as common but should be considered in newborns with cellulitis.
