Ibuprofen

NSAIDs such as ibuprofen should be used as first-line treatment for the control of pleuritic pain (SOR B). While NSAIDs do not have the analgesic potency of narcotics, they do not cause respiratory suppression or change the patientâ€™s sensorium. Corticosteroids should be reserved for patients who cannot take NSAIDs.
