Sexual contact

Genital herpes is the most common sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease in the U.S. It can occur at any age, and data suggest that it may be the most common sexually transmitted disease in women over the age of 50 years. Extragenital sites are involved in one-fourth of infected women, and the sacrum and buttocks are frequent locations. Sacral nerve innervation from the vaginal area provides a pathway for the virus. Prevention of transmission depends upon cogent patient education advising abstinence from skin-to-skin contact when active lesions are present.
