Metformin (Glucophage)

Metformin should be the first medication prescribed for diabetes mellitus when an oral agent is required (SOR A). Metformin can efficiently lower glycemic levels and is linked to weight loss and fewer occurrences of hypoglycemia. It is also less expensive than most other options. If more than one agent is required, continuing metformin is recommended along with the addition of one or more of the following: a sulfonylurea such as glipizide, a thiazolidinedione such as pioglitazone, an SGLT2 inhibitor such as empagliflozin, or a DPP-4 inhibitor such as alogliptin.
