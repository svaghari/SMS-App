No intervention

Internal tibial torsion usually resolves spontaneously by age 5. Surgery may be considered in patients older than 8 years of age who have a severe residual deformity, especially if it is symptomatic or cosmetically unacceptable. Night splints, shoe modifications, other orthotics, casting, and braces are not recommended for this condition.
