Sinus bradycardia

Sinus bradycardia is almost universally present in patients with anorexia nervosa. It is hypothesized that this is due to vagal hyperactivity resulting from an attempt to decrease the amount of cardiac work by reducing cardiac output. It is also possible that the bradycardia can be accounted for by low serum T3 levels, a common finding in persons with chronic malnutrition. Sinus tachycardia may occur with refeeding in patients with anorexia. Other arrhythmias may also occur but are less frequent.
