The patient is unable to passively fully extend the joint

Mallet finger, an injury to the distal extensor tendon of the finger at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, is usually caused by forceful flexion of an extended DIP joint. This is frequently the result of being struck by an object such as a ball. The inability to actively extend the DIP joint is a hallmark of mallet finger. The inability to passively extend the DIP joint completely may be an indication of trapped soft tissue or bone that may require surgery. Up to one-third of distal extensor tendon injuries are associated with an avulsion fracture, and if the avulsion is greater than 30% of the joint space, referral to an orthopedist is recommended. Splinting with strict use of the splint and avoidance of any flexion of the DIP joint is the recommended treatment, and is beneficial even with a delayed presentation. Athletic activities may be continued with the splint in place.
