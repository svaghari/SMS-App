Recommend that she avoid directly handling the cats’ litter box

There is no immunization against toxoplasmosis, and the use of antibiotics is limited to cases in which there is known maternal infection with the protozoa. Screening pregnant women for seroconversion (not with urine antigen testing) is controversial, and recommendations by various professional groups differ. Currently, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology does not recommend routine screening except in patients who are known to be HIV positive. However, because the infection is thought to be passed primarily from undercooked meat or through infected animal feces, it is universally recommended that pregnant women avoid direct contact with cats’ litter boxes. If avoidance is not possible, wearing gloves when handling a litter box is recommended.
