Liver function tests and serum bile acid levels

Whenever a pregnant woman presents with pruritus without a primary rash, it is important to evaluate her
for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. This diagnosis is associated with increased fetal mortality and
warrants increased antenatal surveillance as well as possible induction by 35â€“37 weeks gestation. It is most
appropriate to check for elevation of liver function tests and serum bile acids. Emollients, topical
corticosteroids, and oral antihistamines can all be helpful for pruritus and certain rashes, but in this patient
it is most important to promptly look for the cause of the pruritus. Varicella-zoster immune globulin would
be indicated if she had no immunity to varicella and had been exposed to varicella or if she had a rash that
was suspected to be chickenpox.
