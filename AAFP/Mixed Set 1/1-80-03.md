Elevated urine osmolality

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is related to a variety of pulmonary and central nervous system disorders in which hyponatremia and hypo-osmolality are paradoxically associated with an inappropriately concentrated urine.  Most, but not all, cases are associated with increased levels of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP).  For a diagnosis of SIAD to be made, the patient must be euvolemic and not on diuretics (within 24-48 hours), and the urine osmolality must be high in conjunction with both low serum sodium and low osmolality.  The BUN is normal or low and the fractional excretion of sodium is >1%. Fluid restriction (<800 cc/24 hours) over several days will correct the hyponatremia/hypo-osmolality, but definitive treatment requires eliminating the underlying cause, if possible.  In the case of severe, acute hyponatremia with symptoms (e.g., confusion, obtundation, seizures), hypertonic (3%) saline can be slowly infused intravenously but can have dangerous neurologic side effects. Elevated serum glucose levels give rise to a factitious hyponatremia, but not SIAD. Ref: Ellison DH, Berl T: The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. N Engl J Med 2007;356(2):2064-2072.
