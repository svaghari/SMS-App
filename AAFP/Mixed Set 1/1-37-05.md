amyloidosis

Amyloidosis is defined as the extracellular deposition of the fibrous protein amyloid at one or more sites. It may remain undiagnosed for years. Features that should alert the clinician to the diagnosis of primary amyloidosis include unexplained proteinuria, peripheral neuropathy, enlargement of the tongue, cardiomegaly, intestinal malabsorption, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and orthostatic hypotension. Amyloidosis occurs both as a primary idiopathic disorder and in association with other diseases such as multiple myeloma.
