Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry

Pulse oximetry should be obtained on all pediatric patients with significant tachypnea, pallor, or respiratory distress. It has been found that CBCs, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates are not effective in differentiating between viral and bacterial pneumonia. Chest radiographs are also ineffective in distinguishing viral and bacterial pneumonia, and should be obtained in cases of ambiguous clinical findings, prolonged pneumonia, and pneumonia that is unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, as well as when there is the possibility of complications such as pleural effusions.
