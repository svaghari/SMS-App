Cilostazol (Pletal)

The patient described has symptomatic arterial vascular disease manifested by intermittent claudication. He has already initiated the two most important changes: he has stopped smoking and started a walking program. His LDL-cholesterol is at target levels; further lowering is not likely to improve his symptoms. In the presence of diffuse disease, interventional treatments such as angioplasty or surgery may not be helpful; in addition, these interventions should be reserved as a last resort. Cilostazol has been shown to help with intermittent claudication, but additional antiplatelet agents are not likely to improve his symptoms. Fish oil and warfarin have not been found to be helpful in the management of this condition.
