Order chromatography

Oxycodone often is not detected by an immunoassay test and unexpected results require follow-up with a more accurate test such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography. Codeine can be detected more accurately, but substituting codeine for oxycodone would be inappropriate. Pain management is reasonable if the patient is requiring large amounts of opiates, has failed treatment, or has a history of drug abuse. A pain management agreement should be initiated at the beginning of treatment with an opiate.
