The relative risk reduction (RRR) is the proportional decrease in disease incidence in the treated group relative to the incidence in the control group. In this example the 3% incidence in the treated group is 40% less than the 5% incidence in the control group: (5%–3%)/5% = 40%. The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the difference between the incidence of disease in the treatment group and the incidence in the control group. In this example the ARR is 5% minus 3% = 2%. The number needed to treat (NNT) equals the reciprocal of the ARR: 1/.02 = 50. The RRR is not a very useful statistic in clinical practice. It amplifies small differences and makes clinically insignificant findings appear significant because it essentially ignores the baseline risk of the outcome event. The ARR provides a more useful measure of clinical effect. It answers the question “How much will I decrease my patient’s risk of an adverse outcome by this treatment?” The NNT is also very useful for clinicians, as it answers the question, “How many patients will I need to treat to prevent one adverse outcome?” Ref: Demaerschalk BM: Literature-searching strategies to improve the application of evidence-based clinical practice principles to stroke care.
