Venlafaxine (Effexor XR)

It is important for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to receive psychotherapy. For those
who continue to have symptoms it is appropriate to initiate medications. SSRIs and venlafaxine are
considered first-line medications for the treatment of PTSD. Bupropion and buspirone have not been found
to be effective treatments. The use of benzodiazepine medications is not recommended because of the high
risk of misuse. Antipsychotic medications would be appropriate in patients with disabling symptoms and
behaviors that do not respond to psychological or drug treatment.
