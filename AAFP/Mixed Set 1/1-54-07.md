The child should remain in class and should not be treated unless there is a clear diagnosis and live lice are seen

Head lice is a relatively common infestation in school-aged children and adolescents, but it is often unnecessarily feared and affected children are stigmatized. Since transmission rates are relatively low in the classroom setting and treatments can be expensive and difficult, children suspected of having head lice should remain in class and should not be treated unless there is a clear diagnosis. Nits are louse eggs and do not necessarily represent an active, infectious case of head lice. Childrenâ€™s privacy should be respected appropriately, and in most cases there is no need to notify an entire class or school of the presence of a case of lice.
