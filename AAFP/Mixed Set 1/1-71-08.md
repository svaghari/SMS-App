Propranolol (Inderal)

Propranolol is a first-line therapy for migraine prophylaxis in adults (SOR A). In a review of 26 placebocontrolled trials using data pooled from nine studies, the calculated responder ratio (comparable to relative risk) was 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.6â€“2.35). Other first-line agents include timolol, amitriptyline, divalproex sodium, sodium valproate, and topiramate. 
 Gabapentin, fluoxetine, vitamin B , and naproxen are considered second-line therapies for migraine prophylaxis in adults (SOR B), and should be used when no first-line agent or combination is effective or tolerable.
