Referral for removal under anesthesia

After several unsuccessful attempts to remove an object deep in the ear canal of an uncooperative child, it is best to refer the patient to an otolaryngologist for removal under anesthesia.  Additional attempts are very unlikely to succeed, especially with the techniques listed.  A loop curette cannot be safely placed behind a foreign body that is close to the tympanic membrane.  A round, hard object cannot be grasped with forceps.  Acetone can be used to dissolve Styrofoam foreign bodies, but it would not dissolve a plastic bead.
