Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia

The patient has symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings consistent with a diagnosis of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. This illness is due to an uncontrolled proliferation of lymphocytes and plasma cells, which produce IgM proteins with kappa light chains. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 65 years. Weakness, fatigue, weight loss, bleeding, and recurrent infections are common presenting symptoms. Physical findings include pallor, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Typical laboratory findings include moderate anemia and monoclonal IgM peaks on serum electrophoresis. Bence-Jones protein is seen in 80% of cases, but is typically absent in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Unlike in multiple myeloma, lytic bone lesions are not seen, and marrow biopsy reveals mostly lymphocytes. Sarcoidosis usually presents with hilar lymphadenopathy and a polyclonal gammopathy. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma presents with similar symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, but generally lacks a monoclonal gammopathy and Bence-Jones proteinemia, and has distinctive malignant lymphocytes on bone marrow biopsy.
