coral pink

A Wood’s lamp may assist with the diagnosis of certain skin conditions. This patient’s presentation is consistent with erythrasma caused by a Corynebacterium minutissimum infection, and use of an ultraviolet light would reveal a coral pink color. Pale blue fluorescence occurs with Pseudomonas infections, yellow with tinea infections, and totally white with vitiligo. A lime green fluorescence is not characteristic of a particular skin condition.
