If nausea and vomiting begin after 9 weeks' gestation, secondary causes are more likely to be present

While the exact etiology of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy remains unclear, there are few data to support the theory that psychological factors play a role. Although nausea is usually a self-limited condition, other causes must be ruled out. Secondary causes are more likely to be present if the onset of symptoms occurs after 9 weeks' gestation. Several pharmacologic treatments are proven safe and are superior to placebo in relieving symptoms and preventing hospitalization. Metoclopramide is more effective than placebo and has not been associated with an increased risk of adverse effects on the fetus. Ref: Quinlan JD, Hill DA: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.
