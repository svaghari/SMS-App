spontaneous abortion

This patient has classic pityriasis rosea. This is generally a benign disease except in pregnancy. The
epidemiology and clinical course suggest an infectious etiology. Pregnant women are more susceptible to
pityriasis rosea because of decreased immunity. Pityriasis rosea is associated with an increased rate of
spontaneous abortion in the first 15 weeks of gestation. It is not associated with an increased risk for a
small-for-gestational-age newborn, congenital cataracts, or multiple birth defects.
