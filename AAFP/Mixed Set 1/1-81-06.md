It is acceptable to administer both immunizations at this visit

Low-dose topical, oral, nasal, and intra-articular corticosteroids are not immunosuppressive and do not contraindicate administration of any vaccine.  Influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine can be given together.  Neither is a live vaccine. Ref: Zimmerman RK, Middleton DB: Vaccines for persons at high risk, 2007.
