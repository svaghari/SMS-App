Body mass index (BMI)

According to the DSM-5, the level of severity of anorexia nervosa is based on the patient’s body mass
index (BMI). Mild is a BMI >17.0 kg/m2, moderate is a BMI of 16.0–16.99 kg/m2, severe is a BMI of
15.0–15.9 kg/m2, and extreme is a BMI <15.0 kg/m2. Recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging
behavior help differentiate restricting type from binge-eating/purging type, but do not indicate severity.
Orthostatic changes in pulse or blood pressure and refusal to eat are criteria for inpatient hospitalization,
but are not part of the classification of severity according to the DSM-5. Amenorrhea can be a clinical sign
of anorexia nervosa but is not part of the classification of severity.
