Educational attainment

The Mini-Mental State Examination, developed by Folstein in 1975, has become a standard tool for rapid clinical assessment of cognitive impairment. The score is known to be affected by the patient’s educational attainment. Given the same level of cognitive impairment, those with higher education levels score somewhat better than those with less education. Race, sex, and socioeconomic status per se do not affect patients’ scores. Ref: Ross GW, Bowen JD: The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dementia. Med Clin North Am 2002;86(3):455-476.
