Percentage of body fat

The physiologic changes that accompany aging result in altered pharmacokinetics.  Drug distribution is one important factor.  In older persons, there is a relative increase in body fat and a relative decrease in lean body mass, which causes increased distribution of fat-soluble drugs such as diazepam.  This also increases the elimination half-life of such medications.  The volume of distribution of water-soluble compounds such as digoxin is decreased in older patients, which means a smaller dose is required to reach a given target plasma concentration.  There is a predictable reduction in glomerular filtration rate and tubular secretion with aging, which causes decreased clearance of medications in the geriatric population.  The absorption of drugs changes little with advancing age.  All of these changes are important factors in choosing dosages of medications in the elderly population.
