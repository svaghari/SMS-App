Echocardiography

When evaluating bilateral lower extremity edema, one should first look for systemic etiologies that would result in edema, such as hepatic, renal, or cardiac failure. In patients with obesity or a history of loud snoring, daytime drowsiness, or unrestful sleep, obstructive sleep apnea is likely. These patients can be diagnosed through polysomnography. Echocardiography is also recommended to detect pulmonary hypertension.

Chronic venous insufficiency would be associated with skin changes such as hemosiderin deposits or venous ulcerations. If these findings are present, duplex ultrasonography should be ordered. If there is suspected arterial insufficiency an ankle-brachial index can be determined. For those with a low likelihood of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a D-dimer assay can be ordered, but duplex ultrasonography is a more definitive test. For those with negative ultrasonography, magnetic resonance venography may be needed to rule out a pelvic or thigh DVT. Patients with suspected lymphedema can usually be diagnosed clinically, although lymphoscintigraphy may be required.
