Plantar fasciitis

Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain, with a prevalence of 10% in the general population. It often presents with throbbing heel pain that is worst in the morning with the first step after rest. Palpation of the medial calcaneal tuberosity and dorsiflexion of the affected foot will elicit sharp pain. Diagnostic imaging is not required. Heel spurs are present in approximately 50% of patients with plantar fasciitis, but can also be found in patients without plantar fasciitis.

Calcaneal stress fractures are caused by repetitive overuse and the pain usually begins after an increase in weight-bearing activities or a change in activities. It usually occurs only with activity, but may eventually also occur at rest. Heel pad syndrome causes pain with deep palpation of the middle of the heel or walking barefoot on harder surfaces. Sever’s disease is the most common cause of heel pain in children and adolescents 8–12 years of age.
