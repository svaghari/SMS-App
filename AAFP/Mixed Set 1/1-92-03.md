Administration of 50 µg of RHO immune globulin (RhoGAM)

Both ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous or therapeutic abortion pose a significant risk for fetomaternal hemorrhage. Thus, administration of RHO immune globulin (RhoGAM) is recommended in any Rh-negative patient who is unsensitized (D antibody screen–negative prior to administration of RhoGAM). If the estimated gestational age is 12 weeks or less, 50 mcg of RhoGAM is recommended. If the estimated gestational age is greater than 12 weeks, 300 µg of RhoGAM is recommended.
