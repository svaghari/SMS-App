Anal fissure

Posterior midline fissures cause pain during and after defecation. Most are caused by the passage of hard stool and when stretched cause bleeding. Conservative therapy consisting of bulk agents and stool softeners usually allows these to heal.

Internal hemorrhoids can cause bleeding with the passage of stool but are typically painless. External hemorrhoids can bleed with trauma but typically cause pain with thrombosis, independent of bowel movements. Anal fistulas and perirectal abscesses may intermittently drain purulent material. Abscesses can cause continuous pain, and a perianal mass may be noted on examination.
