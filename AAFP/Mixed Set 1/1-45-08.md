autism

The only evidence-based treatment that confers significant benefits to children with autism is intensive behavioral interventions, which should be initiated before 3 years of age. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can be treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) but medication is often required. CBT is as effective, if not more effective, than medication for treating anxiety, depression, and trauma-related disorders.
