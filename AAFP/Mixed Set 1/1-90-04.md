Polysomnography

Obstructive sleep apnea is increasingly recognized in children. The peak incidence is in the preschool-age range of 2â€“5 years when adenotonsillar tissue is greatest in relation to airway size. It is associated with obesity in older children. Common clinical manifestations include snoring with sleep interruptions and respiratory pauses. Polysomnography is the gold standard for the diagnosis. Although the child has inattention, excessive drowsiness is not seen in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and medications for that condition are not indicated. None of his symptoms suggests a seizure disorder, so an EEG would not be helpful.
