A compressive dressing with weight bearing and range-of-motion exercises as tolerated

The fifth metatarsal has the least cortical thickness of all of the metatarsals. There are strong ligaments and
capsular attachments on the proximal fifth metatarsal that can put significant stress on this area of the bone,
leading to fractures. Nondisplaced tuberosity fractures can generally be treated with compressive dressings
such as an Aircast or Ace bandage, with weight bearing and range-of-motion exercises as tolerated.
Minimally displaced (<3 mm) avulsion fractures of the fifth metatarsal tuberosity can be treated with a
short leg walking boot. If the displacement is >3 mm, an orthopedic referral is warranted.
