Ciprofloxacin eardrops (Cetraxal)

In patients who present with an ear discharge and have ventilation tubes in place, antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroids) can resolve the discharge and improve the illness-related quality of life more quickly than oral antibiotics, corticosteroid eardrops, or saline rinses. The antibiotic eardrops of choice are fluoroquinolones, which are not ototoxic.
