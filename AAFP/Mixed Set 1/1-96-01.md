Administer rubella vaccine immediately post partum

Rubella has been directly responsible for inestimable pregnancy wastage, as well as for severe congenital malformations. Identification and vaccination of unimmunized women immediately after childbirth or abortion is recommended. The use of (-globulin to prevent viremia in nonimmune subjects exposed to rubella is not recommended. The vaccine should be avoided shortly before or during pregnancy since it is an attenuated live virus. Because of herd immunity there is a very low likelihood that this patient will be exposed to rubella.
