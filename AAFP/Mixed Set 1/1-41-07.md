Lace-up ankle support, ice, compression, and clinical follow-up

The Ottawa foot and ankle rules should be used to determine the need for radiographs in foot and ankle injuries. A radiograph of the ankle is recommended if there is pain in the malleolar zone along with the inability to bear weight for at least four steps immediately after the injury and in the physician’s office or emergency department (ED), or tenderness at the tip of the posterior medial or lateral malleolus. A radiograph of the foot is recommended if there is pain in the midfoot zone along with the inability to bear weight for four steps immediately after the injury and in the physician’s office or ED, or tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal or over the navicular bone. The Ottawa foot and ankle rules are up to 99% sensitive for detecting fractures, although they are not highly specific. In this case there are no findings that would require radiographs, so treatment for the ankle sprain would be recommended. Compression combined with lace-up ankle support or an air cast, along with cryotherapy, is recommended and can increase mobility. Early mobilization, including weight bearing as tolerated for daily activities, is associated with better long-term outcomes than prolonged rest.
