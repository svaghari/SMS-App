Excision

This patient has tried first-line treatment for hemorrhoids with increased fiber intake but has returned with
symptoms of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid. Office-based surgical excision of the thrombosed external
hemorrhoid within 2–3 days of symptom onset may provide significant symptomatic relief (SOR B) and
result in a lower risk of recurrence. While conservative treatment with topical therapies such as
corticosteroids may be helpful, symptomatic relief is prolonged with excision of the thrombosed
hemorrhoid.
Bioflavonoids are used outside the United States for symptomatic treatment of hemorrhoids but evidence
is lacking and they are not approved by the FDA for this use. Oral antibiotic therapy has no role in the
treatment of thrombosed external hemorrhoids but may be beneficial in treating an abscess, which would
present with a gradual onset of pain and a fluctuant rectal mass. Rubber band ligation is an appropriate
treatment for grades I–III internal hemorrhoids (SOR A).
