Allowing the patient an oral diet as tolerated

The American Gastroenterological Association guidelines on acute pancreatitis recommend initiating oral
feedings early in the course in order to protect the gut-mucosal barrier, which may limit infectious
complications and does not increase hospital length of stay or other complications. Nasogastric or
nasojejunal tube feeding may be considered at 3â€“5 days if oral feedings are not tolerated. Total parenteral
nutrition is indicated only when enteral feedings cannot supply adequate caloric intake or are not possible
for other reasons. The incidence of single or multiple organ failure or infected necrosis is significantly
increased with the use of total parenteral nutrition.
