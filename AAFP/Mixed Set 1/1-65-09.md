have an estimated life expectancy of less than 6 months

To be eligible for Medicare hospice benefits, a patient must be eligible for Medicare Part A (hospital
insurance). Although most hospice referrals come from physicians, nurses, and social workers, a patient’s
family members can also make a hospice referral. The patient must sign a statement choosing hospice,
and both the patient’s physician and the hospice medical director must certify that the patient has a terminal illness with an estimated life expectancy of less than 6 months. There is no requirement that the patient be debilitated or moribund.
