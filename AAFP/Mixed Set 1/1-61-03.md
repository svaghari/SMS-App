Plain radiographs of the shoulder

Pain in the shoulder of a young athlete can be caused by many problems, including acromioclavicular strain, biceps tendinitis, glenohumeral instability, and rotator cuff pathology. Although rotator cuff pathologies are the most frequent cause of shoulder pain in adults, they are uncommon in children. Unique to children, however, is a repetitive use injury causing disruption at the proximal growth plate of the humerus. This condition is referred to as Little League shoulder and can be seen on plain radiographs as widening, demineralization, or sclerosis at the growth plate. If the radiograph is normal but suspicion for this condition is high, a bone scan or MRI can be ordered.
