Lithium

Lithium is a drug with a narrow therapeutic index and a low volume of distribution. Elderly patients are more likely to develop lithium toxicity due to their lower muscle mass and age-related decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Chronic toxicity is more common than acute toxicity and is often precipitated by events causing volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and acute gastroenteritis. Drugs that impact renal function or volume status, such as ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, and diuretics, can also precipitate toxicity. Chronic toxicity often presents with signs and symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can further worsen toxicity), heart (arrhythmias and conduction delays), and central nervous system (coarse tremors, ataxia, agitation, and confusion). Albuterol and tiotropium both cause transient tremors and tachycardia, but are not associated with ataxia. Atenolol is associated with bradycardia, but not tremors or ataxia (SOR B).
