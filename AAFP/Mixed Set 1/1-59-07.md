Head lag when sitting up

Some abnormal gross motor developmental findings suggest muscular dystrophy. Signs of increased muscular tone, such as cross-legged posturing, neck stiffness, and hyperreflexia, suggest a central cause of motor delay such as cerebral palsy. Head lag due to neck muscle weakness in infants is a classic early finding of muscular dystrophies. Hemiparesis similarly suggests a central nervous system abnormality. Toe walking can be seen with both central and peripheral neuromuscular abnormalities, including muscular dystrophy, but is less specific, and therefore less helpful, in differentiating the cause of motor delay. In muscular dystrophies it is a sign of quadriceps weakness.
