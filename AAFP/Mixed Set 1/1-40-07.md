Patellofemoral pain syndrome

Patellofemoral pain syndrome is a common cause of anterior knee pain, especially in women. It is worse with running downhill or going down stairs. It is not associated with a knee effusion. The examination is often positive for an apprehension test over the patella. A torn meniscus can cause medial joint line tenderness as well as a positive McMurrayâ€™s test, defined as a click and/or pain when moving the knee from flexion to extension with valgus stress. Prepatellar bursitis causes anterior knee pain, usually associated with tenderness, swelling, and redness over the prepatellar bursa. Osgood-Schlatter syndrome causes anterior knee pain over the tibial tuberosity. Pes anserine bursitis causes medial knee pain just distal and slightly posterior to the joint space.
