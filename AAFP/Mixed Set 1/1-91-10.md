American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease)

Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, and is estimated to infect some 300,000 persons in the
United States. Potential consequences include cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and fatal cardiac arrhythmias.
The CDC has designated Chagas disease as a neglected parasitic infection, based on the number of people
estimated to be infected in the United States, the potential severity of the illness, and the ability to prevent
and treat this disease. This infection is considered neglected because relatively little attention has been
devoted to its surveillance, prevention, and/or treatment. It is most common in those who live in rural,
impoverished areas in Mexico or central America, where the vector of the disease, the kissing bug, is
found.

Trichomoniasis can lead to infertility and poor birth outcomes. Toxocariasis and toxoplasmosis cause
developmental defects in children. Cysticercosis can lead to epilepsy in young adults. Some of these
sequelae develop years after an initial mild infection.
