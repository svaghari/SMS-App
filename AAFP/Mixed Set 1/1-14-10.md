Discontinue aspirin and begin apixaban (Eliquis)

This patient has a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3 (hypertension, age 65–74, female), which classifies her as
high risk for thromboembolism. Oral anticoagulation is indicated for patients with a score of 2 or more,
who are at high risk for pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis (PE/DVT) (SOR C). Patients with a
score of 0–1 have a low to medium risk and may use aspirin with or without clopidogrel.
In patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease, novel oral anticoagulants are preferred
(SOR A). They reduce the risk of reinfarction, stroke, and overall mortality in patients with a past history
of myocardial infarction, and also help prevent PE/DVT.
