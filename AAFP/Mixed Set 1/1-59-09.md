Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and cephalexin

Clindamycin or a combination of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (or doxycycline or minocycline) plus cephalexin (or dicloxacillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate) should provide adequate coverage for Streptococcus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for mild to moderate cellulitis.

Doxycycline plus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole would provide inadequate coverage for streptococcal bacteria. Cephalexin plus dicloxacillin would provide inadequate coverage for MRSA. The primary indication for ciprofloxacin is treatment of infections with gram-negative rods. Fosfomycin is indicated only for urinary tract infections. Neither is typically used in the treatment of cellulitis.
