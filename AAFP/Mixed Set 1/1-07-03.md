Cholestyramine (Questran) daily

Diarrhea that develops in patients with ileal Crohn’s disease or following ileal resection is usually due to increased amounts of bile acid remaining in the stool. This affects colonic secretion and motility and various protein factors in the gut, resulting in the development of bile acid diarrhea (BAD). Although various tests can be performed to evaluate the stool, gut flora, and bowel function, a therapeutic trial with a bile acid sequestrant such as cholestyramine is most often used for both the diagnosis and treatment of BAD. Reducing fat intake may also be beneficial. Loperamide can lessen the diarrhea in some patients but should not be the primary treatment because chronic use can result in constipation. Fiber supplementation may help to produce a more formed stool and could be used as an adjunct treatment when appropriate.
