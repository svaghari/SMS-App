Reassurance and surveillance over the next 3–6 months

Premature adrenarche without development of secondary sex characteristics is usually idiopathic and does
not lead to an abnormal pattern of development. Reassurance and surveillance over the next 3–6 months
would be most appropriate at this time. Laboratory studies and radiography warrant consideration if the
patient develops secondary sex characteristics before the age of 8, or if her height velocity increases
rapidly during the surveillance period.
