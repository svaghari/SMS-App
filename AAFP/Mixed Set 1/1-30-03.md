Referral for surgical excision

Infantile hemangiomas usually appear by 4 weeks of age and stop growing by 5 months of age. As many as 70% leave residual skin changes, including telangiectasia, fibrofatty tissue, redundant skin, atrophy, dyspigmentation, and scarring. Systemic corticosteroids were the mainstay of treatment for hemangiomas during infancy until 2008, when the FDA approved oral propranolol for this indication. Intralesional corticosteroids can be effective for small, bulky, well localized lesions in infants. Laser therapy can also be used to treat early lesions or residual telangiectasia. Once involution is complete, however, as is the case with this child, elective surgical excision is the treatment of choice, producing better outcomes.
