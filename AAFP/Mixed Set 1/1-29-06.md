Southeast Asia

Coin rubbing is a traditional healing custom practiced primarily in east Asian countries such as Cambodia, Korea, China, and Vietnam. The belief is that one’s illness must be drawn out of the body, and the red marks produced by rubbing the skin with a coin are evidence of the body’s “release” of the illness. These marks may be confused with abuse, trauma from some other source, or an unusual manifestation of the illness itself.
