Adequate protein intake

Very few nutritional interventions have been shown to accelerate pressure ulcer healing in the elderly.
Maintaining a protein intake of at least 1.2â€“1.5 g/kg/day is recommended, and some authorities
recommend 2 g/kg/day with stage III or IV ulcers. Increased caloric intake is also necessary to promote
healing. The role of vitamins and minerals in preventing and treating pressure ulcers is unclear.
