Observation with follow-up

This patient has unilateral serous otitis and is unlikely to have delayed language from decreased hearing on one side.  The patient should be observed for now.  Hearing loss of longer than 3 months may indicate a need for tympanostomy tubes.  Surgical treatment has been shown to be helpful, but should be reserved for patients with chronic effusion.  Audiometry is not needed to make a decision about surgery at this point.  The mother's judgment is likely correct about his current hearing loss, so a hearing test most likely would not add any useful information.  Numerous studies have shown that all medical treatments for serous otitis are ineffective, including antihistamine and decongestant therapy, and corticosteroids by any route.
