Topical benzoyl peroxide

Oral antibiotics are recommended for acne that is resistant to topical treatments. Oral isotretinoin is indicated for severe nodular acne or moderate acne resistant to other treatments. Since this patient has not tried any therapies, these two options would not yet be appropriate. Topical antibiotics are recommended only in combination with benzoyl
peroxide. Appropriate treatments would be topical benzoyl peroxide, a topical retinoid, and oral contraceptives. Antiandrogen therapies such as spironolactone are not indicated solely for acne vulgaris, although they may be appropriate for concomitant conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome.
