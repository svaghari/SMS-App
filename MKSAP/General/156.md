**Educational Objective:** Treat a patient with a popliteal cyst.

#### **Key Point:** Asymptomatic popliteal cysts do not require treatment; in symptomatic cases, treatment is usually directed at the underlying cause.

The most appropriate management is no treatment. This patient has a popliteal (Baker) cyst. Popliteal cysts are synovial fluid–containing extensions of the knee joint space and generally occur as a result of inflammatory arthritis, osteoarthritis, or trauma of the knee. Swelling is seen in the popliteal fossa on physical examination. The cyst is usually asymptomatic but may become painful as it enlarges or ruptures, which may cause significant pain and swelling of the calf, mimicking thrombophlebitis. The knee should be examined for signs of meniscal pathology, effusion, or mechanical signs that indicate an intra-articular irritant causing excessive joint fluid. Treatment is usually directed at the underlying cause of the cyst (such as repair of a torn meniscus). Given this patient's lack of symptoms, no treatment is required.
In this asymptomatic patient, fluid aspiration is not necessary; it should be performed solely for symptom relief, which is unnecessary in this patient. Although the procedure is considered extremely safe, it does carry a small risk for infection.
When arthritis-related popliteal cysts cause symptoms, joint aspiration of the fluid with a subsequent glucocorticoid injection can often relieve the symptoms. Given that this patient lacks symptoms, the procedure is not indicated.
Ibuprofen or another NSAID can be offered to patients with popliteal cysts to treat pain from the underlying cause of the cyst (such as trauma or osteoarthritis), but these analgesics are not considered first-line therapy for the cysts themselves. In patients with asymptomatic popliteal cysts, NSAIDs have no role.
Plain radiographs can be obtained in patients with trauma when there is concern for fracture or to confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. There is no role for plain radiography in patients with an asymptomatic popliteal cyst.
