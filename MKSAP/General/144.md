
### Correct Answer: C) Rehabilitation at a long-term acute care hospital 

**Educational Objective:** Identify the appropriate level of postdischarge care.

#### **Key Point:** Long-term acute care hospitals provide longer-term, higher-intensity medical treatment, such as complex wound care, mechanical ventilation weaning, and treatment with intravenous medications; such facilities also provide physical rehabilitation services.

The most appropriate discharge plan for this patient is rehabilitation at a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH). The patient requires continued mechanical ventilation but otherwise no longer requires hospitalization. LTACHs provide longer-term, higher-intensity medical treatment, such as complex wound care, mechanical ventilation weaning, and treatment with intravenous medications. Patients can also receive physical rehabilitation at such facilities.
Acute rehabilitation in a specialized rehabilitation facility is an appropriate choice for patients who require short-term rehabilitation (typically <4 weeks). To ensure reimbursement of services, such facilities require that a patient be able to participate in therapy at least 3 hours per day, 5 days per week. This patient clearly does not meet these criteria.
In-home rehabilitation services are useful for patients who may safely return home but still require physical or occupational therapy to continue optimizing return to their previous level of functioning. In-home rehabilitation services would not be a safe option for this patient who still requires mechanical ventilation and has significant physical deconditioning.
Subacute rehabilitation at a skilled nursing facility is a good option for patients who are not physically ready to return to their previous living situation but cannot tolerate at least 3 hours of therapy per day, 5 days per week. Skilled nursing facilities have physician directors but do not have the physician or staff resources to provide the complex medical care this patient requires.
