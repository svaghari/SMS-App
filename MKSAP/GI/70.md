
### Correct Answer: C) Eosinophilic esophagitis 

**Educational Objective:** Diagnose eosinophilic esophagitis.

#### **Key Point:** Eosinophilic esophagitis typically presents in young men with symptoms of dysphagia and in patients with a history of food allergies, eczema, and asthma.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is the most likely diagnosis in this patient. Defined as esophageal squamous mucosal inflammation caused by eosinophilic infiltration, eosinophilic esophagitis is commonly seen in young men presenting with symptoms of dysphagia. It often co-occurs in patients with food allergies, asthma, and eczema. Rings and furrows in the esophagus are common findings on upper endoscopy. The diagnosis is confirmed with biopsies of the esophagus showing more than 15 eosinophils/hpf in the absence of other known causes of esophageal eosinophilia. For patients with confirmed eosinophilic esophagitis, treatment includes restriction of dietary elements (elemental diet or targeted elimination diet) and swallowed aerosolized topical glucocorticoids or a proton pump inhibitor. Patients should also be counseled that the condition may recur.
This patient's endoscopic findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of achalasia. In patients with achalasia, endoscopy often shows a dilated esophageal body with resistance at the gastroesophageal junction. A manometry test confirms the diagnosis of achalasia. The most effective treatment options include pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy.
Candida esophagitis rarely occurs in immunocompetent patients but is seen more often in patients with HIV and other immunocompromised patients. The most common symptom is odynophagia rather than dysphagia. Oral thrush may also be present, but its absence does not exclude esophageal involvement. Endoscopic findings in patients with Candida esophagitis are small, raised, white plaques. It is treated with oral fluconazole and management of the immunocompromised state.
Because this patient takes only a multivitamin and has no ulcers seen on endoscopy, pill-induced esophagitis is unlikely. Pill-induced esophagitis has been observed with medications including alendronate, quinidine, tetracycline, doxycycline, potassium chloride, ferrous sulfate, and mexiletine. Pills typically cause local injury at sites of anatomic narrowing of the esophagus. Clinical symptoms include chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia. Symptoms may begin hours to days after starting therapy, and stopping the medication often leads to symptom relief.
