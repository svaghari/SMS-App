
### Correct Answer: D) Hyperlipidemia 

**Educational Objective:** Recognize hyperlipidemia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

#### **Key Point:** Most cardiovascular risk can be attributed to modifiable risk factors; among them, elevated lipid levels impart the highest risk for cardiovascular disease.

This patient's hyperlipidemia most increases his risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most cardiovascular risk can be attributed to modifiable risk factors, and among them, elevated cholesterol levels impart the highest risk for CVD. Reductions in lipid levels can decrease overall risk, and current cholesterol treatment guidelines focus on risk for future cardiovascular events rather than absolute lipid levels. This patient's 10-year cardiovascular risk based on the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Pooled Cohort Equations risk calculator is 6.9%, and he should be counseled regarding therapeutic lifestyle changes, including dietary modification, regular physical activity, weight loss, and continued smoking cessation. According to the 2018 AHA/ACC Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol, this patient's cardiovascular risk is categorized as borderline (5% to <7.5%). In the presence of risk-enhancing factors, statin therapy is a reasonable consideration. Risk enhancers include family history of premature atherosclerotic CVD (men aged ≤55 years, women aged ≤65 years), LDL cholesterol level of 160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L) or higher, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammatory conditions, history of premature menopause or previous history of preeclampsia, South Asian ancestry, or triglyceride level of 175 mg/dL (1.98 mmol/L) or higher.
Moderate alcohol intake (one to two drinks daily for men, one drink daily for women) has been linked with decreased incidence of CVD; however, heavy alcohol consumption has been shown to increase cardiovascular risk. The deleterious effects of alcohol consumption must be weighed against the potential benefits when patients are counseled about risk modification.
The risk for CVD varies considerably among different ethnic groups. The prevalence of heart disease is lower among persons of Hispanic ethnicity than in most other ethnic groups, and Hispanics tend to have lower rates of traditional modifiable risk factors.
Family history of premature CVD is an independent cardiovascular risk factor but typically adds little precision when included in multivariate risk models. In most studies, premature CVD is defined as CVD in a first-degree male relative younger than 55 years or a first-degree female relative younger than 65 years. A family history of premature CVD doubles the risk for myocardial infarction in men and increases the risk by 70% in women. This patient's father died at age 61 years; therefore, family history is not the most important risk factor for this patient.
Although active smoking remains a strong risk factor for CVD, smoking cessation substantially reduces cardiovascular risk within 2 years, with risk returning to the level of a nonsmoker at approximately 10 years. Smoking status should be addressed at every visit, and cessation counseling should be offered to patients who are actively smoking.
