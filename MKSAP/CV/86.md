
### Correct Answer: B) Inappropriate sinus tachycardia 

**Educational Objective:** Diagnose inappropriate sinus tachycardia.

#### **Key Point:** Diagnosis of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is based on symptoms and findings on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring after the exclusion of other causes of tachycardia, such as hyperthyroidism, anemia, pheochromocytoma, and structural heart disease.

This patient with sinus tachycardia and a structurally normal heart has symptoms, electrocardiographic features, and ambulatory electrocardiographic findings consistent with the diagnosis of inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST). IST is characterized by elevated resting heart rate, with exaggerated increases in heart rate with light activity. The sinus rates typically decrease during sleep, as identified on this patient's ambulatory electrocardiographic monitor. IST frequently presents in women in their second to fourth decades and appears to be more common in health care professionals. Symptoms vary and can include palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope or near-syncope, dyspnea, and fatigue. Emotional manifestations, such as anxiety or depression, may also be present. Diagnosis of IST is based on the exclusion of other causes of tachycardia, such as hyperthyroidism, anemia, pheochromocytoma, and structural heart disease. First-line therapy is removal of aggravating factors and exercise therapy. In patients with bothersome and persistent symptoms, pharmacologic therapy with β-blockers or calcium channel blockers can be considered. Ivabradine is a relatively new drug that impairs the If or “I-funny” current and may play a role in the treatment of IST refractory to standard therapy.
The diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder are as follows: (1) excessive anxiety or worry about a number of events or activities occurring for 6 months or longer; (2) the patient recognizes it is difficult to control the worry; (3) the anxiety or worry is associated with three or more of the following symptoms: restlessness, easy fatigability, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance; (4) the anxiety, worry, or symptoms cause impairment at school, work, or other settings and cannot be attributable to medical or other psychiatric conditions, medications, or substance use. Diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom disorder include at least one somatic symptom causing distress or interference with daily life; excessive thoughts, behaviors, and feelings related to the somatic symptom(s); and persistent somatic symptoms for at least 6 months. This patient does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder.
Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a laboratory-based diagnosis, defined as the presence of a suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone level with normal triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis are typically mild; most patients are asymptomatic. This patient's normal thyroid-stimulating hormone level argues against this diagnosis.
