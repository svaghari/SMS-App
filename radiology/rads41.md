#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:**There are multiple large areas of airspace opacification projecting over both lung fields.

Areas of opacification project primarily over the lower and mid-zones, and completely obscure the heart border.

The right base is more dense, suggesting possible pleural effusion, with fluid laterally and in the horizontal fissure.

**Lateral CXR Interpretation:** T12 has diffusely and homogeneously increased density – an ‘ivory vertebra’ (this is actually visible on the PA – but we are easily distracted…). This refers to a diffuse homogeneous increase in opacity of a vertebral body that otherwise retains its size and contours. 

Multiple rounded patches of airspace opacification throughout the left lung field and fluid within the horizontal fissure.

#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from blood cultures 24 hours later. Echocardiogram demonstrated tricuspid valve endocarditis. The patient had recently had a PICC line in situ for chemotherapy treatment of lymphoma.

#### CLINICAL PEARLS
MRSA Pneumonia and bacteraemia has a high fatality rate. If a patient with known MRSA bacteraemia is requiring inotropic support, mortality approaches 50%.
