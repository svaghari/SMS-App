#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is barium within both lower lobes, worse on the right. Some barium has reached the gastrointestinal tract. There is an NG tube in situ and a left renal / ureteric stent.

**Video Fluoroscopy Interpretation:** Video fluoroscopy demonstrates free flow of contrast into the trachea.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This barium bronchogram is unlikely to harm the patient or lung parenchyma, no specific treatment is required

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
This chest X-ray appearance is is unlikely to resolve. Bronchography used to be widely performed before computed tomography and involved (deliberately) passing radiological contrast into the airways â€“ very useful for delineating structural abnormalities such as bronchiectasis.
