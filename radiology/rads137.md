#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
Small lung volumes and atelectasis in the right base. No consolidation. There is air under the right hemidiapragm and the liver appears displaced downwards.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This lady had a perforated bowel with free air in the abdomen – causing a ‘floating liver‘. This supine film does not give the more obvious air under the diaphragm picture [See CXR Case 141]. She had severe metabolic acidosis and inflammatory response and survived surgery.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
This is not Chilaiditi sign – but does have a similar appearance – where colonic interposition above the superior border of the liver – a cause of pseudo-pneumoperitoneum. 

Chilaiditi syndrome (Demetrius Chilaiditi 1883–1975) – is interposition of the colon over the liver associated with upper abdominal pain.
