#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There are bilateral pneumothoraces. There are increased lung markings suggestive of underlying lung parenchyma infiltrate such as pulmonary fibrosis. Bilateral small pleural effusions.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is bilateral spontaneous secondary pneumothorax (SSP). The hypoxaemia supports the assumption of underlying lung disease. This patient needs bilateral chest drains.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Bilateral pneumothorax is quite rare and should prompt consideration that there may be a mediastinal pleural defect – either iatrogenic from intervention, or rarely ‘buffalo chest‘ – where both pleural spaces are in communication. 

Note: Buffalo’s have no mediastinal pleura – i.e. a single pleural space. This explains why Native Americans were able to kill 400 kg buffalo with a single arrow to the chest, causing a tension pneumothorax…
