#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is a needle projecting over the right heart border in the right lower zone. Otherwise a normal film.

**Lateral CXR Interpretation:** The needle appears to be in the right lower lobe, medial segment airway.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Bronchoscopy confirmed the presence of the needle in the right lower lobe.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
There are safer places to temporarily store needles than the mouth.

Larger inhaled foreign bodies can cause peripheral collapse of the airways and obstructive pneumonia

Rigid bronchoscpy can often be required to remove some foreign bodies, especially if there is concern with possible haemorrhage.
