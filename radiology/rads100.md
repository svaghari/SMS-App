#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION

There is a large right sided pneumothorax.No evidence of trauma. The left lung looks congested but no obvious parenchymal disease.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION

With no known underlying lung disease this is a primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP; although the fact that a pneumothorax has occurred suggests underlying lung disease…). Marijuana smoking is associated with the development of early bullous emphysema, although this is not apparent on the left side.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS

The size measurement of PSP is arbitrary
* the British guidelines suggest >2cm from chest wall to pleural edge at the level of the hilum
* the Americans suggest >3cm from apex to cupola.

Neither matter very much – the increasing evidence is that PSP can either be left completely alone and will resolve slowly, or simple aspiration using a 14G or 16G cannula is all that’s needed. 

Size doesn’t matter although if you must the most reliable means of assessing size if through CT.
