#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Plombage, also known as extraperiosteal or extrapleural pneumonolysis, is an obsolete treatment method for cavitary tuberculosis of the upper lobes of the lungs. A cavity is created under the upper ribs, and compression of the upper lobes is achieved by inserting an inert substance such as oil, paraffin wax or gauze. As Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an aerobe â€“ it dies when the ventilation to the upper lobe is abolished.
