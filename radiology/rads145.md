#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
The tip of the ET tube is in the right main bronchus. There is a large bore chest drain on the left side, the tip appears to sit in the medial costophrenic angle. 

NG tube correctly placed. No pneumothorax visible, lung parenchyma look normal. There may be a thin rim of air under the left hemidiaphragm – a supine film or CT is required. The apices of the lungs are not properly visualized.

#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
The ETT needs pulling back. The chest drain does not necessarily require re-positioning – the pleural space is in continuity, it won’t drain air there, but will if there is a further tension.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Beware of chest drains in CT scanners.
