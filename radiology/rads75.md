#### IMAGE INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is a rounded, spiculated opacity projected over the right hilum. Otherwise, lung fields, pleura and bones appear normal.

**CT Chest Interpretation:** CT chest demonstrates a rounded mass abutting the anterior mediastinum

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is probably a primary lung cancer.The absence of any other tumours in the chest (as confirmed by CT) make metastases far less likely.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
On the original CXR, the right inferior pulmonary artery (and other hilar structures) are visible through the lesion â€“ meaning that the lesion must be either anterior or posterior to the hilum itself because of the different density of normal aerated lung between the two (similar density) structures.
