---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This lady has pneumonia and a secondary pneumothorax.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
There is no RCT evidence that large bore drains are any more useful in pneumothorax than smaller bore (e.g. 12-14F).

They are, however, proven to hurt a lot more during insertion and afterwards.
