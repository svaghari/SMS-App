#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is complete white out of the left lung caused by pneumonia (air bronchograms mid zone).

There is partial volume loss with collapse because the right heart border and trachea have shifted to the left.

There is a large bore chest drain in situ on the left.

ETT (probably a bit too proximal) and NG tube also present

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Severe pneumonia can rarely cause secondary pneumothorax.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Most pneumothoraces do not require a large bore drain, 12-14F may well be adequate.
