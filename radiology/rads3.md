#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
This CXR demonstrates bronchiectasis.

There are coarse, thickened airway markings with ring shadows bilaterally, but worse in the left upper lobe (obscuring the heart border) and left lower lobe, obstructing the hemidiaphragm.

There is also scoliosis of the spine

The CT demonstrates bronchiectais with markedly dilated airways and thickened airway walls with patches of sputum plugging.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Concurrent airways disease is common in bronchiectasis and should be treated similarly to acute asthma.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Bronchiectasis patients frequently have airways obstruction which behaves similarly to asthma in presentation and response to treatment.
