#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There are bilateral moderate pleural effusions. There is fluid in the horizontal fissure and upper lobe diversion.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Common things are common: bilateral effusions are highly likely to be transudates from heart failure. This man had a history of type II diabetes and NSTEMI with 2x coronary stents 4 years before presentation.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
In the absence of any concerning aspects to the history (weight loss, malignancy, fevers) it would be reasonable not perform a diagnostic tap of the effusions. Treat the cause (i.e. dry the patient out) and review. Rarely, in the context of severe respiratory failure a therapeutic tap can improve the respiratory mechanics and oxygenation â€“ but beware anti-platelet and novel oral anticoagulants!
