#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is an air fluid level in a large cavity in the left upper zone with associated increased airspace shadowing and left hilar adenopathy. 

There is increased lucency above the air fluid level with scanty lung markings suggesting this is either a large cavity or involving the pleural space. The rest of the lung parenchyma and pleural spaces are normal.

#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Malignancy and TB would be the most important diagnoses to consider.

A CT scan and culture of sputum (including Acid Fast Bacilli) would be the next best steps.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Reactivation of old quiescent TB is rare but possible following immune suppression, particularly multiple factors such as age, diabetes and steroids.
