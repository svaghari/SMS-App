#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is a large right sided pleural effusion filling the entire hemithorax. Left lung field and pleura is clear. Large gastric bubble. Bilateral nipple rings.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
A large unilateral pleural effusion is very likely to be malignant. The other most common cause would be parapneumonic effusion, although you would expect severe sepsis for this size of effusion.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Cytological examination of the fluid for malignant cells is a mandatory next step. The diagnostic yield from this varies depending on tumour type, which is due to different proportions of malignant cells shed into the pleural fluid.
