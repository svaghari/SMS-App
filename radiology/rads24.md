#### INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is bilateral basal atelectasis with otherwise clear lung fields. 
AP, rotated film.

**CT Interpretation:** CTPA demonstrates bilateral, proximal acute pulmonary emboli.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Atelectasis is a relatively uncommon but recognized feature of PE on plain CXR and small pleural effusions can be present in up to 40% of cases with PE

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
It is not the appearance on CTPA that dictates treatment – the physiological response to the PE is the critical element.
