#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is complete collapse of the right upper lobe
* Note the resultant elevation of the right horizontal fissure 
* Patchy Left Upper Lobe (LUL) opacification suggestive of consolidation
* ETT and NG tube also present*

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
* This is a case of severe pneumonia 

Right upper lobe collapse has distinctive features, and is often easily identifiable on CXR. 

Features include: increased density in the right upper lung field, elevation of both the right hilum and right horizontal fissure, and loss of the right cardiomediastinal contour.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS

A common cause of upper lobe collapse is a proximal tumour or mediastinal mass.

An acute collapse normally correlates with a sudden worsening of symptoms, particularly breathlessness

Consider malignancy in patients who present with weight loss, cough and/or haemoptysis
