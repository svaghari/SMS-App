#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is a right tension pneumothorax with displacement of the mediastinum to the left. There is a right sided air fluid level suggesting haemothorax. No obvious rib or clavicular fractures.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Tension pneumothoraxThis needs immediate recognition and a needle decompression. Rapid progression to a decent size chest tube is indicated.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Hypotension could be due to circulatory shock from the tension pneumothorax (reduced venous return from raised intrathoracic pressure) or from the haemothorax. Persistent hypotension after treating the tension would suggest hypovolaemia.
