#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is dextrocardia.

The stomach gas bubble is also on the right side, suggesting situs inversus

There are coarse, thickened bronchial markings and small ring shadows, most notable in the upper lobes, consistent with bronchiectasis

---------------
#### CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

Kartagener syndrome describes Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), bronchiectasis and situs invertus.

* Other features include chronic sinusitis, infertility

Diagnosis of PCD is with nasal brushings and biopsy to assess ciliary beat frequency with video microscopy; a poor man’s test is with the saccharin test – time for saccharin to be tasted in the mouth after deposition of droplet of saccharin on the inferior turbinate of the nose.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS

About 30% of those with PCD will have situs inversus with, or without, dextrocardia as the cilia determine the side of the organs. Random organ siting occurs, hence the situs inversus.
