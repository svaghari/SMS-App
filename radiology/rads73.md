#### IMAGE INTERPRETATION
There is a right superior hilar mass. There may be paratracheal adenopathy superior to it. Lung fields and pleura clear. Lateral confirms that this likely tumour is anterior and superior to the hilum.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is squamous cell lung cancer. The proximity to the carina and adjacent lymphadenopathy preclude surgery as a treatment option.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Squamous cell lung cancer is usually more central / proximal and classically can cavitate. These central airway cancers are becoming less common due to filters in cigarettes being more widely used over recent decades and less horrible tobacco within the cigarettes.
