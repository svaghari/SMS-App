#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is a large hiatus hernia and air fluid level within the stomach. There is consolidation in the right base. Otherwise lung parenchyma and pleura are normal.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Aspiration pneumoniaIt is highly likely that this lady has aspirated her stomach contents into her right lung. After recovery, if fit for surgery then a repair of this hiatus hernia should be considered, particularly if this is a recurrent problem.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Aspiration may be the cause of recurrent chest infection – you don’t have to have a hiatus hernia – any swallowing dysfunction may be enough.
