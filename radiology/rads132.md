#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is aneurysmal dilation and unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Heart size is possibly enlarged. Left base is indistinct raising possibility of a pleural effusion.

**CT Angiogram Interpretation:** CT angiogram demonstrates a dissection flap in the descending aorta.

#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
The key important issue is to distinguish between an ascending OR descending dissection. This case was in fact an ascending dissection (i.e. Stanford type A or DeBakey type I). This needs surgery.

#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Having proposed a classification of aortic dissection, at age 97 DeBakey himself developed aortic dissection. Michael Ellis DeBakey (1908-2008) also engineered elements of the first cardiopulmonary bypass machine, pioneered carotid endartectomy and the use of dacron vascular grafts.
