#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There are multiple small nodular lesions bilaterally, with a predominately basal distribution. No pleural involvement.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is leiomyomatosis. The basal distribution and multiple different sizes of lesions suggests haematogenous spread of tumour, in this case uterine myomas.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Leiomyomatosis is results from haematogenous spread of ‘benign’ uterine fibroid. There is commonly a venous tumour burden, masquerading as DVT / PE. Treatment is with hysterectomy and anti oestrogen / gonadotrophin analogues as the cells are very hormone responsive. There is a rare hereditary form of leiomyomatosis that also includes renal cell cancer and cutaneous lesions.
