#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is over-inflation of both lung fields with flattening of the hemidiapragms. There is a large spiculated mass in the right upper lobe.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is consistent with COPD (predominant emphysema as gas trapping ++) and a primary lung cancer

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
After adjustment for tobacco smoke exposure, the presence of COPD remains an independent risk factor for development of lung cancer. This is probably related to the chronic inflammatory milieu in the lungs.
