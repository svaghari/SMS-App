#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. The lung fields are otherwise clear

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy should always be further investigated, as lymphoma (primarily Hodgkin’s) is an important cause. Differentials include: sarcoidosis, silicosis and tuberculosis.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Up to half of patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma have radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy on plain CXR at the time of clinical presentation and about 85% on CT, which would be the next investigation of choice. 

The clear lung fields should not put clinicians of the possibility of TB or sarcoidosis.
