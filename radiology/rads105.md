#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is a left sided hydropneumothorax. No obvious pleural or lung parenchymal disease.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is associated with known underlying lung disease. This is at least strongly suspected in this case â€“ a small pleural effusion (e.g. blunting of costophrenic angle, probably from heamothorax) is seen in ~20% of spontaneous pneumothoraces, but in this case there is too much fluid and this needs further investigation.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Pleural fluid cytology demonstrated adenocarcinoma from lung primary. The tumour was on the periphery of the lung and had invaded the visceral pleura, causing the malignant pleural effusion and pneumothorax.
