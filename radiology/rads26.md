#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There are diffuse increased interstitial markings throughout both lungs without zonal distribution. The reticular-nodular pattern is consistent withÂ pulmonary fibrosis

There is an air-fluid level overlapping the heart shadow, with absence of usual gastric air sinus. This is in keeping with a large hiatus hernia

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This patient is at risk of aspiration, and given the context of unlikely infection, this is the most likely reason for the acute presentation. 

She has a background of pulmonary fibrosis which in this case is not caused by aspiration, but is a well recognized complication of pulmonary fibrosis.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Acute aspiration of gastric contents causes a chemical pnuemonitis and the role of empirical antibiotics is controversial. Many patients recover quickly over 24-48 hours. Supportive therapy and oxygenation may be required. Should clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia develop, then antibiotics are indicated. 

In the community setting the most frequently isolated organisms are: S. Aureus, S. pneumoniae, Bacteroides sp., Fusobacterium and Prevotella sp.

In the hospital setting, the spectrum differs: S. aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp. and Pseudomonas aeroginosa.
