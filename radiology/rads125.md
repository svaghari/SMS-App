#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
None of these signs are likely to account for the clinical presentation, although it would be worthwhile exploring symptoms of heart failure (and perhaps arrhythmia).

This is a good example of a very prominent finding on an X-Ray distracting the reader from more subtle findings â€“ stick to your routine despite what you find!
