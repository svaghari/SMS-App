#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
Non-infective exacerbation COPDThe lung fields are overinflated with flattened hemidiagragms consistent with airways disease and COPD.

No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
The flattened hemidiaphragms are a sign of overinflation from gas trapping from the emphysema.

Attempts to increase tidal volume are usually offset by a reduction in expiratory time – leading to dynamic hyperinflation.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Exacerbation of COPD – associated with sustained falls in FEV1.

Attempts to mitigate this with early physio and pulmonary rehabilitation programs are critical to avoid permanent loss of lung function.
