#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There are multiple small calcified parenchymal densities projecting over both lung fields.

The lungs are otherwise clear.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
A common cause for small calcified lung opacities is healed varicella pneumonia.

These lesions are usually 2-3mm in size, and are randomly scattered throughout the lungs.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
A differential for small nodules in the lungs includes chronic exposures in occupation-specific conditions such as silicosis and coal workerâ€™s pneumoconiosis.
