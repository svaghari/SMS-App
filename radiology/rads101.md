#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is a large left pneumothorax, with partial inflation of the upper lobe apparent in the mid zone, and the edges of the lingula and lower lobe can be visualised in the lower zone. The right lung parenchyma appears normal

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Most primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) will resolve with time. Recurrent PSP (2 or more events) may require VATS pleurodesis / pleurectomy as it is likely to continue to recur.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Recurrence is much higher in persistent smokers â€“ this is an important teachable moment for smoking cessation.
