#### IMAGE INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is a large soft tissue mass arising from the right superior mediastinum. The right hilum appears bulky. Both lung fields are over-inflated consistent with COPD.

**CT Chest Interpretation:** CT demonstrates a large cystic structure arising from the superior mediastinum with thin walls. It is partially obstructing the airway due to external compression.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Mediastinal cysts are relatively uncommon. This will need further work up, however surgery may be indicated. Causes of mediastinal cysts include bronchogenic, thymic, pericardial, enteric and from teratoma.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
While thymic cysts are most common in the anterior mediastinum, others can occur in the middle mediastinum from ectopic remnant thymic tissue
