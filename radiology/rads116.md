#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is patchy airspace shadowing over the medial aspect right mid zone. The hila structures are still visualized. The remaining parenchyma and pleura are clear.

**Lateral CXR Interpretation:** There is lobar consolidation of the right apical segment, lower lobe.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is lobar pneumonia. Considering the description of ?haemoptysis – pneumococcal pneumonia is possible as this classically produces a ‘rusty brown‘ sputum which, in turn, classically is miss-labelled as haemoptysis.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Pneumococcal urinary antigen is strongly recommended in many community acquired pneumonia guidelines. It is a simple, cheap investigation with good sensitivity with rapid processing time. A positive pneumococcal urinary antigen in the appropriate clinical setting would support narrowing antibiotics to treat for Streptococcus pneumoniae.
