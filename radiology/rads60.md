#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There are air bronchograms and consolidation in the medial segment of the left lower lobe.

The rest of the lung fields are clear.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This isÂ pneumococcal pneumonia. The left medial hemidiaphragm is obscured, confirming that this is involving the lower lobe.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Streptococcus pneumoniae is cultured in 20-25% of cases of community acquired pneumonia but is responsible for ~65% of cases with bacteraemia from pneumonia.

Studies using PCR to isolate S pneumoniae suggest the incidence may be 35-40% of CAP cases (very variable on region and population studied).

The use of PCR to detect S pneumoniae and other common pathogens may well become routine practice in years to come.
