#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Radiation pneumonitis refers to the acute phase of radiation-induced lung disease (RILD). Onset of symptoms is typically between 4 and 12 weeks post radiotherapy, though may be earlier. Symptoms vary from mild to the more severe and include cough, dyspnoea, low grade fever and pleuritic chest pain. Patients can become markedly hypoxaemic, depending on how much lung is affected. Differentials can include infection, lymphangitis, hypersensitivity to chemotherapy or other drugs, heart failure or PE.

In this case the strongly demarcated line is an indication of the edge of the radiation field *

#### CLINICAL PEARLS
High dose corticosteroid therapy is indicated for radiation pneumonitis.
