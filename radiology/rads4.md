#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is consolidation throughout the right side, sparing the periphery.

There is also an air bronchogram behind the heart. This is most likely a pneumonia.

* Note the ETT and left subclavian line

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
The sparing of the lung periphery is unusual but does not necessarily mean this is caused by an atypical organism.

‘Atypical’ pneumonia accounts for about 20% of all pneumonia so they are not very atypical!

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Consolidation does not always mean infection; it describes an airways infiltrate which is usually inflammatory or rarely blood.
