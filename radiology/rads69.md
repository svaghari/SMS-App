#### IMAGE INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is infiltration of the left apex with a large soft tissue mass with rib destruction/invasion. Lung fields appear over-inflated consistent with COPD.

**CT Interpretation:** CT confirms the presence of an invasive tumour with clavicle, 1st and 2nd rib destruction.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is a left sided Pancoast tumour.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
In some circumstances surgery is possible with Pancoast tumour â€“ usually a lobectomy and some rib / chest wall resection. MRI is very useful at informing the degree of any soft tissue invasion. Otherwise, adequate analgesia to cover the local and neuropathic pain (brachial plexus invasion) with radiotherapy, is indicated for symptom control.
