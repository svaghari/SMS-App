#### IMAGE INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is patchy airspace shadowing in the left upper lobe, more dense inferiorly. There is some volume loss on the left and multiple rounded areas representing non-consolidated emphysema. Remaining parenchyma and pleura are normal.

**CT Chest Interpretation:** CT chest confirms the presence of emphysema with surrounding consolidation.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Intercurrent infection is very common in COPD. The appearances on CXR are sometimes thought to be abscesses â€“ but there is no fluid level and there are just too many to make this likely.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
This man needs a repeat CXR in ~8 weeks to ensure that there is no lung cancer within the area of consolidation (the initial CT chest will not reliably tell us this).
