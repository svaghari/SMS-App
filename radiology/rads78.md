#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is widespread, bilateral airspace opacification with air bronchograms. The peripheries are relatively spared. ETT, central venous access and NGT are noted.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (‘GPA‘) – old school Wegener’s granulomatosis. The renal failure is from associated glomerulonephritis.  PR-3 ANCA (c-ANCA) was positive. High dose corticosteroids was started, followed by cyclophosphamide – he survived. The differential of the CXR includes a severe (infective) pneumonia.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Other radiological appearances of GPA are nodules that may or may not be cavitating. Upper airways symptoms are very common in GPA (~95%) such as nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge, epistaxis,  and upper airway (and mouth) ulcers.
