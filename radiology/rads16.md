#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
Presenting CXR: There is complete collapse of the left lower lobe (LLL) creating the sail sign behind the heart and volume loss in the left hemithorax. There are age-related bony changes of the thoracic vertebral column and ribs. The lung fields are overinflated, consistent with gas trapping from airways disease. 

Presenting CXR: The left lower lobe is now re-inflated

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Left lower lobe collapse has distinctive features, but may sometimes be missed on CXR.
* Features of left lower lobe collapse include: edge of collapsed lung creating a ‘double cardiac contour,’ loss of normal left hemidiaphragm outline

A lateral CXR is useful in looking for left lower lobe collapse – a triangular outline representing the collapsed lung may be visible posteriorly. In this case the patient was hydrated and had lots of chest physio – this is frequently enough to re-inflate collapsed lobes from retained secretions or sputum plugs.

#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Cardiomegaly may make it difficult to identify left lower lobe collapse.
