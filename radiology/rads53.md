#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is volume loss and fibrosis in the left upper lobe (hilum pulled up). There is airspace opacification in the right lower lobe on a background of possible fibrosis throughout both lung fields.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This man has acute right sided pneumonia, exacerbating his already weak ventilatory reserve.

The left upper lobe fibrosis is highly likely to be caused by TB.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Sending sputum cultures for AFB is mandatory in this situation – this guy had reactivation of his TB – nothing like some positive pressure to help generate aerosolized mycobacterium!
