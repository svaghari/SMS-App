#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
The heart is on the right side representing dextrocardia. Situs inversus is present (gastric bubble also on the right side). No free air under the diaphragm. No evidence of any bronchiectasis.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Assuming the ‘L’ maker was correctly placed, then this is a case of incidentally found dextrocardia and situs inversus. Kartagener syndrome (primary ciliary dyskinesia) is very unlikely: there is no radiological evidence of bronchiectasis; the patient has previously fallen pregnant (likely functioning cilia in the Fallopian tubes)

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
The LLQ pain was from appendicitis. With situs inversus, the gut is rotated – with the appendix on the left side.
