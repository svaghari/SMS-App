#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is bilateral hilar adenopathy with a predominantly nodular infiltrate in the lung fields, sparing the bases.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is sarcoidosis (Stage II on radiological classification).

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Other than a biopsy and CT chest, routine tests to investigate sarcoidosis should include lung function including gas transfer, ECG, renal function, calcium, serum ACE levels.

Note: Angiotensin-converting Enzyme (ACE) levels are not diagnostic of sarcoidosis and a normal serum ACE with sarcoidosis is equally possible.

Serum ACE is only useful to track disease progression / response, if it is elevated.
