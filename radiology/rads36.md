#### INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is diffuse air space shadowing in the right mid zone with an area of central lucency and air fluid level.

A left nipple ring is notedThe rest of lung parenchyma and pleura are normal

**CT Interpretation:** CT demonstrates a thick walled cavity in the apical segment of the right lower lobe.

There is an air fluid level with some surrounding consolidation

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
The most likely diagnosis is aspiration from reduced conscious level causing a lung abscess and systemic sepsis.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
The anatomical location of an abscess caused by aspiration relates to the position an individual was lying / sitting in when aspiration occurs â€“ with the apical segment of the lower lobe often being the first stop for aspirated material when lying supine.
