#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is a rounded soft tissue mass in the right lower lobe with probable ipsilateral hilar adenopathy. There is a further smaller lesion in the left upper lobe laterally. The pleural spaces are clear.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is likely to be lung cancer. The lesion on the left side suggests metastases are present and the seizure should alert to the possibility of cerebral metastases.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
About 40% of non small cell lung cancer is diagnosed at an advanced stage (stage 4), contributing significantly to the poor outcome (<10% 5 year survival).
