#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There are widespread, bilateral calcified asbestos-related pleural plaques. These are affecting the diaphragm and mediastinal pleura as well as (more commonly) the lateral parietal pleura. Lung parenchyma is normal.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Asbestos-related pleural plaques are the most common form of asbestos related lung disease. Despite their characteristic appearance they do not need specific follow up – they are a sign of asbestos exposure but do not contribute to breathlessness or any increased risk of mesothelioma or lung cancer.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Rarely pleural plaques are associated with an angina-like chest pain.…this is, however, a diagnosis of exclusion!
