#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is diffuse opacity over the left hemithorax and loss of distinction of the upper margins of the left heart border.Pleural spaces are clear, right side normal.Sternotomy wires noted.

**CT Interpretation:** There is diffuse opacity over the left hemithorax and loss of distinction of the upper margins of the left heart border.Pleural spaces are clear, right side normal. Sternotomy wires noted.

#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
In this scenario a sputum plug causing sudden lobar collapse is quite possible. Assuming intubation is not required, then chest physio is the key to success. Careful but adequate analgesia is required to allow meaningful coughing despite the sternotomy wound.

#### CLINICAL PEARLS
The radiological appearance of Left upper lobe (LUL) collapse is often referred to as a ‘veil-like‘ opacity.
