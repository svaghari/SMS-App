#### CLINICAL PEARLS
An indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) is a silicone-rubber tunneled chest drain that enables ambulatory management of malignant pleural effusions. IPC’s are safe with chemotherapy (no increased infection risk) and even withstand local radiotherapy! The pleural infection rate is ~5% of patients with an IPC – a sterile technique should be used to sample from an IPC or connect to drainage.
