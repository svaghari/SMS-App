#### INTERPRETATION
**CXR Interpretation:** There is bilateral hilar adenopathy.

There are a few subtle reticulonodular shadows within the lung parenchyma.

Clinical Image: This is erythema nodosum

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is sarcoidosis, specifically Löfgren syndrome.

The lung parenchyma changes are subtle and would require CT to confirm.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Löfgren syndrome is generally a more mild acute presentation of sarcoidosis, with fever, bilateral hilar adenopathy, erythema nodosum and arthralgia. It is far more common in Caucasians and generally has a good prognosis with 80-90% resolving over 1-2 years.
