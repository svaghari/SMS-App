#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is patchy, diffuse airspace shadowing in both lung fields, worse on the left side. There is a large tunneled subclavian IV access cannula in situ on the right. No pneumothorax.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This man had microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) with MPO-ANCA (old term: p-ANCA) positive staining. The vascath is for dialysis following acute renal failure.  The infiltrates could represent some fluid overload, however, in the context of being ‘ANCA positive’, inflammatory infiltrates are likely. .

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
High dose corticosteroid therapy followed by cyclophosphamide or azathioprine, and more recently rituximab (with continued steroids), is indicated for MPA.
