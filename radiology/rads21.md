#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There are widespread, patchy rounded infiltrates of varying size throughout both lung fields.The infiltrates appear more confluent and dense in the lower lobes, perhaps representing some consolidation.Some of the lesions in the upper zones appear to be cavitating.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
Possible differentials for this appearance include:
* cavitating pulmonary metastases (e.g. squamous cell, adenocarcinoma from GI tract or breast, sarcoma)
* septic pulmonary emboli
* Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
The increased density and size of the lesions in the lower lobes favor haematological spread of, in this case,Â lung metastases.
