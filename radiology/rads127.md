---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
This lady has fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Multiple low trauma rib fractures might suggest an underlying connective tissue disorder. The odd lesion in the left upper zone is likely heterotropic ossification after trauma.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
Fibrodysplasia ossificans is a very rare heritable disorder characterized by congenital malformation of the great toes, heterotropic ossification and sometimes progressive chest wall deformity with kyphoscoliosis and ventilatory failure causing type II respiratory failure.
