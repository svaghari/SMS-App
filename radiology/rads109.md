#### CHEST X-RAY INTERPRETATION
There is subtle upper lobe diversion and bilateral small pleural effusions. Lower zones bilaterally have possible patchy airspace opacification. There is a single chamber pacemaker and a metallic mitral valve replacement. Right shoulder prosthesis noted.

---------------
#### CLINICAL CORRELATION
The CXR is consistent with mild pulmonary oedema. This man has a metallic Starr-Edwards MVR. This requires significant anticoagulation (normally INR 3-3.5) hence any confusion after a fall should lead to consideration / investigation for intracranial bleed.

---------------
#### CLINICAL PEARLS
The Starr-Edwards MVR is a ball-cage valve, the use of which was first reported in 1961; it has been highly successful and used globally. The valve has sometimes been associated with a mild haemolytic anaemia. 

Catastrophic complications, such as cage rupture and embolism of the ball are, thankfully, very rare.
