### ** Correct Answer: **

**D - Cumulative incidence** - Cumulative incidence is the proportion of new cases of disease (here cleft deformities) over a defined period of time (here 5 years). It represents the likelihood of developing the disease during that time. It is calculated by dividing the number of new cases in a given time period by the population at risk in the same time interval.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Mortality rate** - Mortality rate refers to the number of deaths within a group during a period of time. The investigator is interested in cases of disease, not death.

**B - Prevalence** - Prevalence includes all cases of a disease in a population, both new and preexisting. This investigator, however, is only interested in new cases of cleft deformities within the 5-year span.

**C - Relative risk** - Relative risk compares the risk of disease in one group (exposed to a risk factor) to the risk of disease in another group (without exposure to the risk factor). Although this investigator is interested in the rate of cleft palate, she is not comparing two groups that differ by exposure to a risk factor.

**E - Odds ratio** - Odds ratio is a statistical measure commonly used in case-control studies. Odds ratio compares the odds of exposure to a specific event or risk factor between a group with a disease and a group without the disease. This investigator is not comparing risk exposure between groups.

**F - Attributable risk** - Attributable risk is the proportion of disease occurrence among exposed individuals attributable to that exposure. Here, however, the investigator is only considering the overall number of newly diagnosed cases of oral cleft deformities, irrespective of exposure status.
