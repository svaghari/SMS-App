### ** Correct Answer: **

**D - 15.0%** - The case fatality rate for the most common organism causing pneumonia that requires hospitalization is 15.0%. There were 460 cases of pneumonia caused by S. aureus in the study cohort, of which 69 were fatal. The case fatality rate, therefore, is 69/460 = 0.15, or 15.0%.

Question Difficulty: 3

** Other Answers: **

**A - 10.4%** - This value is the overall mortality rate for all patients of pneumonia that were admitted to the hospital: 137 deaths/1323 cases = 0.104 (or 10.4%). However, this journalist is asking about the mortality rate of pneumonia caused by one specific pathogen.

**B - 50.3%** - This value is the proportion of fatalities attributable to S. aureus (69/137 â‰ˆ 0.503, or 50,3%). Although S. aureus is indeed the most common pathogen causing pneumonia that leads to hospital admission, this value does not represent the case fatality rate.

**C - 34.8%** - This value is the proportion of total cases caused by S. aureus, otherwise known as incidence: 460 cases/1323 total cases = 0.348 (or 34.8%). While this value correctly identifies S. aureus as the most common pathogenic causing pneumonia that required hospital admission, the journalist is most interested in identifying the mortality rate of this infection, not the incidence.

**E - 12.5%** - This value is the case fatality rate from P. aeruginosa, 17 deaths/136 cases = 0.125 (or 12.5%). However, the journalist is interested in the case fatality rate of pneumonia caused by a different pathogen.
