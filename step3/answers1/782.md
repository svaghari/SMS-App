### ** Correct Answer: **

**H - Psoriatic arthritis** - This patient meets many diagnostic criteria of the CASPAR classification for psoriatic arthritis, including psoriasis, psoriatic nail dystrophy, negative rheumatoid factor, and dactylitis. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which also affects the hands, the metacarpophalangeal joint is usually not involved in psoriatic arthritis, although the distal interphalangeal joint is.

Question Difficulty: 1

** Other Answers: **

**A - Reactive arthritis** - Reactive arthritis causes polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, tendinopathy, dactylitis, and extra-articular symptoms such as skin lesions. While this patient presents with arthritis and dactylitis, polyarthritis in reactive arthritis usually involves the lower extremities, and skin lesions would present differently (hyperkeratinization of the palms and soles). The latency period of reactive arthritis is typically 1–4 weeks, but the urinary tract infection in this patient was one year ago.

**B - Secondary syphilis** - Although this patient's sexual history puts her at risk of syphilis, secondary syphilis is characterized by constitutional symptoms (generalized nontender lymphadenopathy, fever, fatigue) and a polymorphic rash that is typically reddish-brown or copper-colored. None of these features are present in this patient.

**C - Ankylosing spondylitis** - Ankylosing spondylitis causes back pain, which is also seen in this patient, but it does not typically affect the hands and fingers. It also does not cause any of the extra-articular symptoms seen in this patient. Furthermore, it more commonly affects men 20–30 years of age.

**D - Rheumatoid arthritis** - Rheumatoid arthritis causes oligoarthritis, which usually affects the hands, and is also present in this patient. However, the distal interphalangeal joints are typically spared, whereas the metacarpophalangeal joints are typically affected. Furthermore, rheumatoid factor is usually positive in rheumatoid arthritis, although it has a low specificity for the disease.

**E - Arthritis-dermatitis syndrome** - Arthritis-dermatitis syndrome is a potential manifestation of disseminated gonococcal infection, which has a classic triad of symptoms that includes arthralgias, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis. While the patient does present with arthralgias and her sexual history puts her at risk of infection, her skin lesions are not consistent with those in arthritis-dermatitis syndrome, she lacks fever, and the condition does not cause the dactylitis and nail changes seen in this patient.

**F - Degenerative osteoarthritis** - Degenerative osteoarthritis typically affects the weight-bearing joints (knees, hips) first, not the hands and fingers. It also would not explain any of this patient's other symptoms, as osteoarthritis does not cause any extra-articular symptoms.

**G - Systemic lupus erythematosus** - SLE can cause various symptoms, including rash and arthritis, as in this patient. However, the rash would typically be a malar rash (butterfly rash) with sparing of the nasolabial folds. Additionally, this patient has none of the other typical findings of SLE, such as fever, fatigue, photosensitivity, or Raynaud phenomenon.
