### ** Correct Answer: **

**A - 0.04** - The event rate in the group with exposure to the intervention is the number of pesticide poisonings in the group with the aldicarb ban, which is 10/1000. The event rate in the group without exposure to the intervention is the number of pesticide poisonings in the group that did not ban aldicarb, which is 100/2000. Therefore, the absolute risk reduction = (100/2000) - (10/1000) =0.05 - 0.01 =0.04 or 4%.

**B - 0.2** - This value is the relative risk of exposure to the intervention (aldicarb ban), which is calculated by taking the event rate in the group with exposure to the intervention divided by the event rate in the group without exposure to the intervention (aldicarb ban) = (10/1000) / (100/2000) = 0.01/0.05 = 0.2.

**C - 25** - This value is the number needed to treat, which is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (the reciprocal of the difference of the event rate in the group without exposure to the intervention and the group with exposure to the intervention), which = 1/ [(100/2000) - (10/1000)] = 1/(0.05 - 0.01) = 25.

**D - 0.19** - This value is the odds ratio, which is calculated as the ratio between the odds of the event in the group with exposure to the intervention, which is (10/1000) / (990/1000) = (10/990), and the odds of the event in the group without exposure to the intervention, which is (100/2000) / (1900/2000) = (100/1900). The odds ratio is therefore (10/990) / (100/1900) = (10 x 1900) / (990 x100), which is approximately 0.19.

**E - 90** - This value is the difference in the number of pesticide poisonings between the group without exposure to the intervention (aldicarb ban) and the group with exposure to the intervention, which is 100 - 10 = 90.

**F - 0.8** - This value is the relative risk reduction, which is calculated with the formula 1 - (relative risk). The relative risk of exposure to the intervention (aldicarb ban) is calculated by taking the event rate in the group with exposure to the intervention divided by the event rate in the group without exposure to the intervention = (10/1000) / (100/2000) = 0.01/0.05 =0.2. Thus, the relative risk reduction = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
