### ** Correct Answer: **

**D - Clopidogrel** - Long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor (e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) is the recommended regimen for all patients after reperfusion therapy. DAPT reduces mortality and the risk of developing subsequent ischemic episodes and stent thrombosis. The duration of DAPT is an individual decision based on bleeding risk and the risk of stent thrombosis. After PCI with stent placement, DAPT is usually recommended for 12 months. In addition to DAPT, long-term pharmacotherapy for secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome consists of an ACE-inhibitor, beta blocker, nitrate, and a high-dose statin therapy. Low-dose aspirin therapy is continued lifelong.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Valsartan** - ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) improve mortality and left ventricular ejection fraction after acute coronary syndrome. Initiation of treatment with an ACE inhibitor or ARB is recommended for stable patients within the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. However, this patient already receives lisinopril therapy, and combination therapy with both an ACE inhibitor and an ARB is not recommended.

**B - Nifedipine** - Nifedipine therapy is associated with increased mortality after acute myocardial infarction; therefore, it should be avoided in the acute management of coronary artery disease. Nifedipine can be added as an adjunct to beta blockers in patients with stable ischemic heart disease.

**C - Enoxaparin** - Anticoagulation therapy is indicated in the management of acute coronary syndrome. For patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy, enoxaparin is appropriate; unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin are preferred for patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Anticoagulation is not indicated after discharge from the hospital.

**E - Spironolactone** - Treatment with an aldosterone receptor antagonist such as spironolactone is indicated following an acute myocardial infarction in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 40%) who develop symptoms of congestive heart failure (e.g., paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, lower extremity edema) or have a history of diabetes mellitus. This patient does not meet the criteria for treatment with spironolactone.

**F - Propranolol** - Cardioselective beta blockers (e.g., metoprolol) are considered standard of care in the management of acute coronary syndrome in the absence of contraindications such as bradycardia, hypotension, congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. Beta blockers are also indicated for the treatment of chronic stable coronary artery disease; however, nonselective beta blockers such as propranolol and high doses of cardioselective beta blockers can cause bronchoconstriction due to inhibition of β2 receptors and should be used with caution in patients with reactive airway disease such as this patient with asthma.
