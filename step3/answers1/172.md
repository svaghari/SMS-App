### ** Correct Answer: **

**H - Avascular necrosis** - Avascular osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a common complication in patients with SCD and typically manifests between 7â€“15 years of age. This adolescent boy's subacute hip pain and lack of systemic symptoms are classic for avascular osteonecrosis, which occurs due to trabecular bone infarction from RBC sickling and vaso-occlusion. The femoral head is commonly affected as a result of poor collateral blood supply.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Transient synovitis** - Transient synovitis is a common cause of self-limited hip pain and limping in children, and is often preceded by upper respiratory tract infection. This patient is slightly older than the usual presenting age (< 10 years), and his underlying SCD makes a different diagnosis more likely.

**B - Developmental dysplasia of the hip** - Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a condition that presents in infancy. If left untreated, it may lead to chronic hip pain and limping in older children and can predispose patients to complications including avascular necrosis, early osteoarthritis, and leg length discrepancy. This patient does not have any prior symptoms or history to suggest this diagnosis.

**C - Impaired skeletal growth** - Patients with SCD are at increased risk of impaired skeletal growth. The etiology is multifactorial and is at least partially due to premature closure of the long bone epiphyses. Although this patient has evidence for impaired growth based on his low percentiles in height and weight, it would be unlikely to cause his subacute, unilateral hip pain.

**D - Slipped capital femoral epiphysis** - Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a common hip disorder in adolescent males, and can also present with pain and limited range of motion. However, his low weight and absence of family history make SCFE less likely. His underlying SCD makes a different diagnosis more likely.

**E - Osteomyelitis** - Patients with SCD are at increased risk of osteomyelitis due to functional asplenia. Although osteomyelitis may also present with localized pain, it is usually accompanied by systemic findings (e.g., fever, chills, leukocytosis). This patient's isolated hip pain and history of SCD are concerning for a different diagnosis.

**F - Stress fracture** - Stress fractures are caused by repetitive applications of force (usually from over-training), and most commonly affect the tibia and metatarsal bones. Although this patient recently started playing flag football, there is no history to suggest excessive training. Furthermore, a stress fracture involving the hip would be very unusual.

**G - Septic arthritis** - Patients with SCD are at increased risk of septic arthritis due to functional asplenia, which develops in early childhood due to recurrent infarction of the spleen. Septic arthritis can also present with severe hip pain and limited range of motion, as seen in this patient. However, additional symptoms such as fever, joint swelling, and erythema would also be expected. His normal leukocyte count makes this diagnosis unlikely as well.
