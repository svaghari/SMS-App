### ** Correct Answer: **

**B - Discontinue alendronate** - Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate) can directly injure the esophageal mucosa in case of prolonged contact and cause drug-induced esophagitis. The most appropriate next step in the management of this condition is to discontinue the offending drug, if possible, and observe for symptom improvement. Most cases will then heal without further intervention. To minimize recurrence, medications should be switched to liquid formulations or taken with liquids or meals to minimize the risk of the drug tablet sticking in the esophagus. Remaining upright for 30 minutes after taking the drug is also effective. Other common medications that can cause drug-induced esophagitis include antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines, clindamycin), NSAIDs, potassium chloride, quinidine, and iron compounds.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Start ganciclovir** - Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, which can cause esophagitis. However, upper endoscopy of CMV esophagitis classically shows multiple, linear ulcers at the lower esophageal sphincter, not a punched-out ulcer with normal surrounding mucosa.

**C - Start nystatin** - Nystatin is an antifungal drug used to treat Candida albicans infections, which can cause esophagitis. This patient has an increased risk of developing fungal infections due to the chronic use of a steroid inhaler for asthma control. However, upper endoscopy of Candida esophagitis classically shows small, raised, white plaques and oral thrush, not a punched-out ulcer with normal surrounding mucosa.

**D - Start pantoprazole** - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as pantoprazole are used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can cause retrosternal chest pain as seen in this case. However, upper endoscopy of GERD classically shows diffusely inflamed mucosa in the lower esophagus with mucosal breaks, not a punched-out ulcer with normal surrounding mucosa. PPIs are often used as an adjunctive treatment for drug-induced esophagitis because GERD can exacerbate esophageal injuries; however, the effectiveness of this intervention is unclear.

**E - Discontinue amlodipine** - Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as amlodipine induce muscle relaxation and decrease lower esophageal sphincter tone, which can increase the risk of developing drug-induced esophagitis. However, CCBs do not directly cause this condition; discontinuation of amlodipine is not the most appropriate next step in the management.

**F - Start fluconazole** - Fluconazole is an antifungal drug used to treat Candida albicans infections, which can cause esophagitis. This patient has an increased risk of developing fungal infections due to the chronic use of a steroid inhaler for asthma control. However, upper endoscopy of Candida esophagitis classically shows small, raised, white plaques and oral thrush, not a punched-out ulcer with normal surrounding mucosa.
