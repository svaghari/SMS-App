### ** Correct Answer: **

**C - 85–115** - This is the only answer option that lies between 1 and 2 standard deviations from the mean. In a normal distribution, approximately 87% of measurements fall within 1.5 SDs from the mean (± 15 IQ points in this case). While knowing this specific value is not necessary, it is important to remember the values for 1 SD (68%), 2 SDs (95%), and 3 SDs (99.7%).

Question Difficulty: 3

** Other Answers: **

**A - 70–130** - This range (statistics) represents 99.7% (3 SD ≅ 30 IQ points) of IQ measurements, but not the range that includes 87% of all IQ levels measured.

**B - 65–135** - This range (statistics) represents almost 100% of IQ measurements (> 3 SDs from the mean), but not the range that includes 87% of all IQ levels measured.

**D - 80–120** - This range (statistics) represents 95% (2 SD ≅ 20 IQ points) of IQ measurements, but not the range that includes 87% of all IQ levels measured.

**E - 90–110** - This range (statistics) represents 68% (1 SD ≅ 10 IQ points) of IQ measurements, but not the range that includes 87% of all IQ levels measured.

**F - 95–105** - This range (statistics) represents < 50% of IQ measurements (< 1 SD from the mean), but not the range that includes 87% of all IQ levels measured.
