### ** Correct Answer: **

**B - Switch to oral clozapine** - Clozapine is usually the first-line therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia because it is more effective than other antipsychotics. Clozapine increases the risk of agranulocytosis. Therefore, the benefits and risks of treatment, as well as the patient's ability to adhere to treatment and follow-ups, must be weighed and discussed with the patient and their family. Before initiating clozapine, the leukocyte count and differential should also be assessed; regular monitoring is indicated during treatment. Patients must be additionally monitored for adverse metabolic effects (e.g., weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia) since atypical psychotics also increase the risk of metabolic syndrome.
