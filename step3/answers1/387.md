### ** Correct Answer: **

**G - Amlodipine** - Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) often used in the treatment of hypertension. The primary mechanism by which dihydropyridine CCBs lower blood pressure is by causing peripheral arterial vasodilation. As a result, dihydropyridine CCBs have a high incidence of peripheral edema as a side effect. Other common side effects include headaches, dizziness, facial flushing, and reflex tachycardia.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Losartan** - Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). While ARBs are used in the treatment of hypertension, the most commonly associated side effect is hyperkalemia. Losartan is unlikely to have caused this patient's peripheral edema.

**B - Prazosin** - Prazosin is a selective alpha-1 blocker. Alpha blockers are sometimes used as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of hypertension. However, the most commonly associated side effects are postural hypotension and headache. It is unlikely that a patient with no history of antihypertensive therapy would be started on prazosin as a first-line agent. This patient's peripheral edema is more likely caused by a different antihypertensive agent.

**C - Propranolol** - Propranolol is a nonselective beta blocker. While beta blockers are used in the treatment of hypertension, the most commonly associated side effects are bradycardia and hypotension, as well as bronchospasm for nonselective beta blockers. Beta blockers rarely cause peripheral edema.

**D - Lisinopril** - Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. While ACE inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypertension, the most commonly associated side effects are dry cough, angioedema, and hyperkalemia. Angioedema is distinct from the more limited symptom of peripheral edema observed in this patient, which is more likely caused by a different antihypertensive agent.

**E - Spironolactone** - Spironolactone is an aldosterone receptor antagonist. While it can be used as a potassium-sparing diuretic in the treatment of hypertension, the most common associated side effects are hyperkalemia and endocrine disturbances (antiandrogen effects). Spironolactone is unlikely to have caused this patient's peripheral edema.

**F - Hydralazine** - Hydralazine is a direct peripheral vasodilator that is sometimes used as adjunct therapy in the treatment of hypertension. However, its most commonly associated side effect is reflex tachycardia, and it is unlikely that a patient with no history of antihypertensive therapy would be started on hydralazine as a first-line agent. This patient's peripheral edema is more likely caused by a different antihypertensive agent.

**H - Hydrochlorothiazide** - Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Although thiazide diuretics are used in the treatment of hypertension, the most commonly associated side effects are orthostatic hypotension, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. Hydrochlorothiazide would not have caused this patient's peripheral edema.
