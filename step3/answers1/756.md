### ** Correct Answer: **

**C - Vitamin K** - Vitamin K levels are low in all newborns because very little crosses the placental barrier, and its concentration in breast milk is insignificant. In addition, newborns have sterile intestines, and the establishment of gut microflora that synthesizes vitamin K takes approximately 6 months. As vitamin K is necessary for the production of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, not supplementing it within a few hours after birth can enable a potentially fatal hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Another risk factor for vitamin K deficiency bleeding of the newborn is prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
