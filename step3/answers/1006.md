### ** Correct Answer: **

**C - Risedronate** - This patient's drug-induced esophagitis is most likely due to oral bisphosphonate therapy (e.g., risedronate). Bisphosphonates, which inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, are the first-line treatment for Paget disease of the bone. Oral bisphosphonates may cause erosive esophagitis and esophageal cancer, especially in patients who do not maintain an upright posture for 30–60 minutes after ingestion. Other side effects of bisphosphonates (both IV and oral) include aseptic osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fractures, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. IV bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronate) may cause an acute-phase reaction with flu-like symptoms 24–72 hours after administration.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Calcium citrate** - Calcium citrate may be given as a supplement to prevent hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism in Paget disease of bone. However, calcium citrate is not associated with esophagitis.

**B - Denosumab** - Denosumab inhibits osteoclasts and reduces bone resorption. It is administered as a subcutaneous injection to treat osteoporosis. Denosumab is not currently recommended for use in Paget disease of bone, and it is not associated with esophagitis.

**D - Calcitonin** - Calcitonin reduces bone resorption and disease activity in Paget disease of bone. Because it is less effective than the first-line treatment, it is only used if the first-line therapy is poorly tolerated. Calcitonin is administered as a subcutaneous injection and does not cause esophagitis.

**E - Prednisolone** - Oral prednisolone can cause drug-induced esophagitis, peptic ulcers, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. However, prednisolone should be avoided in patients with Paget disease of bone because prolonged use may lead to osteoporosis and further increase the risk of fragility fractures. Therefore, it is unlikely that this patient was treated with prednisolone.

**F - Acetaminophen** - Acetaminophen can cause drug-induced esophagitis and may be used as an adjunct to help relieve bone pain in Paget disease of bone. However, acetaminophen is not the first-line therapy for this condition, and the preferred treatment option for this patient is associated with a higher risk of esophagitis than acetaminophen.
