### ** Correct Answer: **

**F - Chondrosarcoma** - Chondrosarcoma is the second most common nonhematological primary bone malignancy. Primary chondrosarcoma typically affects the pelvis, proximal femur, or proximal humerus of individuals 50–70 years of age and manifests with progressively worsening pain. A swelling can occasionally be palpated but may not be readily apparent in all patients, especially those with pelvic or proximal femoral involvement. On x-ray, chondrosarcomas appear as osteolytic lesions with a moth-eaten or permeative pattern of bone destruction and spiculated, popcorn-like, or ring-and-arc sclerosis, which are characteristic of chondroid matrix calcification. Other radiological features include an aggressive periosteal reaction and endosteal scalloping. Biopsy typically shows cartilaginous growth with nodular architecture.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Osteosarcoma** - Osteosarcomas, which are the most common nonhematological primary bone malignancies, can affect any site, including the pelvis, and appear on x-ray as a mixed lytic-sclerotic lesion with an aggressive periosteal reaction (classically sunburst appearance and Codman triangle). Nighttime pain is also a characteristic feature of osteosarcomas. However, primary osteosarcomas have a peak incidence during the second decade of life, and the metaphyses of long bones (typically the distal femur, proximal tibia, or proximal humerus) are more commonly affected than flat bones (e.g., the ilium). While osteosarcoma cannot be entirely excluded in this patient without histopathological evaluation, the patient's age and the location of the lesion make another diagnosis more likely.

**B - Giant cell tumor** - A giant cell tumor of the bone (osteoclastoma) can cause progressively worsening pain and appear on x-ray as an osteolytic lesion. However, osteoclastoma appears in individuals 20–40 years of age, affects the epiphyseal/metaphyseal region of the long bones (e.g., distal femur, proximal tibia, distal radius), and typically shows up on x-ray as a well-defined, soap-bubble-like lesion with a nonaggressive periosteal reaction. Involvement of the axial skeleton is uncommon, and sclerosis within the lesion would not be expected.

**C - Plasmacytoma** - A plasmacytoma, the most common primary bone malignancy in patients above the age of 40 years, can involve the pelvis and present as a painful osteolytic lesion. However, a plasmacytoma would characteristically appear as a well-defined, punched-out lesion, in contrast to the poorly defined lesion with a moth-eaten pattern of bone destruction seen in this patient. Moreover, sclerosis within the lesion would not be expected, and a periosteal reaction is typically absent.

**D - Ewing sarcoma** - Ewing sarcoma can affect the flat bones (e.g., the ilium) and present similarly with pain in the buttock, an osteolytic lesion on x-ray, and an aggressive periosteal reaction (classically an onion-peel appearance). However, sclerotic lesions are not seen in Ewing sarcoma. Moreover, Ewing sarcoma typically occurs before the age of 30 years (peak incidence: 10–15 years) and more commonly involves the diaphyses of long bones (typically the femur, tibia, fibula or humerus).

**E - Osteochondroma** - An osteochondroma is a benign, slow-growing primary bone tumor that is usually asymptomatic and discovered as an incidental finding on imaging. It occurs on the metaphysis of long bones (typically the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus) and would characteristically appear as a small bony protrusion, in contrast to the poorly defined lesion with a moth-eaten pattern of bone destruction seen in this patient.
