### ** Correct Answer: **

**B - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole** - Prophylaxis for opportunistic infections is indicated in severely immunosuppressed patients, such as organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive drugs or patients with acquired immunodeficiency disorder (AIDS). Prophylaxis includes trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). In addition, valganciclovir is indicated for CMV prophylaxis. This patient is on immunosuppressive therapy after kidney transplantation and should, therefore, receive both drugs.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Azithromycin** - While azithromycin would be an appropriate antibiotic for prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), this is not part of the universal prophylaxis for organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy. Instead, MAC prophylaxis should be started for HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts < 50/mm3 when there is a delay in initiating antiretroviral therapy (usually due to patient refusal).

**C - Meningococcal vaccine** - Meningococcal vaccination is indicated routinely for children at age 11 and for adults with an increased risk of exposure (e.g., military recruits, college dorm residents) or severe infection (e.g., asplenia, terminal complement deficiency). This patient's kidney transplant does not place him at elevated risk for Neisseria meningitidis infection. Apart from live vaccines, which are contraindicated for immunosuppressed patients, organ transplant patients should receive all recommended vaccinations.

**D - Acyclovir** - This patient is at risk for opportunistic viral infections such as CMV. High-dose oral acyclovir can be used for CMV prophylaxis, but it is not considered first-line and is not part of the universal prophylaxis for organ transplant recipients. Valganciclovir or ganciclovir are recommended first-line treatments for CMV prophylaxis; these agents also decrease the incidence of reactivation of other herpes virus infections.

**E - Itraconazole** - While itraconazole would be an appropriate antifungal for prophylaxis against histoplasmosis, this is not part of the universal prophylaxis for organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy. Rather, histoplasmosis prophylaxis should be started for HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts < 150/mm3 who live in regions hyperendemic for histoplasmosis (e.g., American midwest).

**F - Varicella vaccine** - While inactivated vaccines can be administered as early as 1 month after kidney transplantation, live vaccines, such as the varicella vaccine, are contraindicated in solid-organ transplant recipients.
