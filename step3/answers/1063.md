### ** Correct Answer: **

**A - Osteoarthritis** - This patient's occupational joint loading and obesity are two major modifiable risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA). Cleaners are at particular risk for knee OA because they often perform excessive repetitive movements that strain the knees, such as kneeling, climbing stairs, and standing. Obesity is one of the strongest risk factors for OA of weight-bearing joints (e.g., knee, hip, hand) and is known to both increase its incidence and accelerate the disease progression. This patient's female sex and her potential family history of osteoarthritis (i.e., mother's “joint disease”) further increase her risk for this condition. Other nonmodifiable risk factors of OA include age (> 55 years), history of joint injury or trauma, anatomic factors causing asymmetrical joint stress (e.g., genu varum), hemophilic hemarthroses, and deposition diseases that stiffen cartilage (e.g., gout).

**B - Deep vein thrombosis** - This patient's obesity, occasional cigarette smoking, and possible chronic venous disease (i.e., minimal bilateral ankle edema) increase her risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, she lacks other major transient or chronic risk factors for DVT such as recent surgery or immobilization, active cancer, previously documented DVT (all are part of the Wells score for DVT), use of oral hormonal contraception, or hereditary thrombophilia. She is at greater risk for developing a different condition.

**C - Rheumatoid arthritis** - This patient has several risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis, including being a premenopausal woman, obesity, a potential family history of rheumatoid arthritis (i.e., mother's “joint disease”), and cigarette smoking. However, her occupation as a cleaner and her obesity put her at higher risk for developing a different, more prevalent condition.

**D - Chronic cholecystitis** - Chronic cholecystitis may result from recurrent episodes of acute cholecystitis or chronic irritation of gallbladder mucosa by cholelithiasis. While this patient has several risk factors for cholelithiasis (obesity, female sex, age), she has no history of recurrent acute cholecystitis or symptoms suggestive of present gallstones (e.g., recurrent postprandial right upper quadrant pain). She is at greater risk for developing a different condition.

**E - Central sleep apnea** - Risk factors for central sleep apnea include age > 65 years, male sex, chronic opioid use, history of stroke, and certain medical conditions (e.g., heart failure, myasthenia gravis), none of which this patient has. She does, however, have several risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea such as obesity, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption before sleep.
