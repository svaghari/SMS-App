### ** Correct Answer: **

**A - Disseminated intravascular coagulation** - Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can occur after sepsis, a condition that typically presents with poor general condition, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Given this patient's history of fever and productive cough and his lung examination, his sepsis is likely due to severe community-acquired pneumonia. His low blood pressure and altered mental status should raise concern of progression to septic shock. This patient's ecchymoses, thrombocytopenia, prolonged PTT, and acute kidney injury (as indicated by increased creatinine, increased BUN, and electrolyte abnormalities) further support the diagnosis. Management in this case involves treatment of the underlying pneumonia, supportive measures for hemodynamic and ventilatory support, and prevention and treatment of bleeding and thrombosis.

** Other Answers: **

**B - Hemolytic uremic syndrome** - HUS could also cause acute kidney injury and thrombocytopenia. However, it typically occurs after diarrheal illness in children and also causes microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Laboratory evaluation typically shows markedly decreased Hb (< 8–9 g/dL) and a normal PT.

**C - Adverse effect of carbamazepine** - Carbamazepine can cause drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia through antibody-mediated platelet destruction. However, carbamazepine would not cause this patient's prolonged PT, prolonged aPTT, altered mental status, pulmonary symptoms, tachypnea, or tachycardia.

**D - Uremic platelet dysfunction** - Uremia is associated with altered mental status and platelet dysfunction, and subsequent bleeding can cause ecchymoses. This patient's diabetes puts him at risk of developing end-stage renal disease. However, uremia does not cause a prolonged PT and aPTT. Additionally, uremia would not cause this patient's pulmonary symptoms, tachypnea, or tachycardia.

**E - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura** - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) can cause fever, altered mental status, ecchymoses, acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia. However, laboratory evaluation typically shows markedly decreased Hb (< 8–9 g/dL) and a normal or only mildly prolonged PT. Although a prolonged PT may be explained by this patient's history of taking warfarin, it would not cause a significantly prolonged aPTT. Additionally, TTP would not cause pulmonary symptoms, tachypnea, or tachycardia.

**F - Immune thrombocytopenic purpura** - ITP could also cause ecchymoses and thrombocytopenia. However, patients are typically asymptomatic. An acute form is more common in children and a chronic form is more common in women of childbearing age. Laboratory evaluation typically only shows thrombocytopenia with no other abnormalities.

**G - Adverse effect of warfarin** - Patients who take warfarin often experience easy bruising and have prolonged PT. However, warfarin would not cause this patient's thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, pulmonary symptoms, tachypnea, or tachycardia. Additionally, because this drug only affects the extrinsic coagulation pathway, it would not cause a prolonged aPTT.
