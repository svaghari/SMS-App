### ** Correct Answer: **

**A - Narrowing of the central spinal canal** - This patient most likely has cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), which is caused by the narrowing of the central spinal canal due to degenerative changes of the spine. This condition most commonly affects older adults (> 50 years of age) and usually manifests with neck pain (which can radiate to the arms due to concomitant nerve root compression), paresthesias, findings of lower motor neuron injury at the level of the lesion (e.g., hyporeflexia), and findings of upper motor neuron injury below the level of the lesion (e.g., hyperreflexia, Babinski sign). Diminished biceps reflex in this patient suggests a lesion at the level of C5-C6, the most commonly affected region. Other manifestations of CSM include gait instability and, less frequently, bladder dysfunction. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI.

**B - Atherosclerotic occlusion of the anterior spinal artery** - Atherosclerotic occlusion of the anterior spinal artery (ASA) causes ASA syndrome (ASAS), which can manifest with muscle weakness and findings of upper motor neuron (UMN) injury (e.g., hyperreflexia, Babinski sign), both of which are seen here. ASAS can also manifest with signs of lower motor neuron (LMN) injury (e.g., decreased muscle tone, hyporeflexia) in the acute stages. However, unlike this patient, patients with ASAS do not present with findings of LMN and UMN injury at different levels at the same time. Moreover, the ASA supplies the anterior ⅔ of the spinal cord, so its occlusion typically causes loss of temperature and pain sensation (due to ischemia of the spinothalamic tracts) rather than loss of fine touch sensation, for which the dorsal columns (supplied by the posterior spinal arteries) are responsible. Finally, since the artery of Adamkiewicz is the most commonly occluded artery, the arms are not typically involved in ASAS; affected individuals usually present only with involvement of the lower extremities.

**C - Autoimmune destruction of acetylcholine receptors** - Autoimmune destruction of acetylcholine receptors is the underlying cause of myasthenia gravis (MG), which can manifest with muscle weakness and most commonly affects male individuals between 60 and 80 years of age. However, the majority of patients with MG present with ocular symptoms of ptosis and diplopia, which are not seen here; limb weakness alone is an uncommon manifestation of MG. Moreover, MG would not explain the history of worsening neck pain, changes in deep tendon reflexes, and fine touch sensation seen in this patient.

**D - Mutation of the superoxide dismutase gene** - A superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1) mutation is associated with a genetic predisposition to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Patients with ALS present with findings of both lower motor neuron injury (i.e., hyporeflexia) and upper motor neuron injury (i.e., hyperreflexia, Babinski sign), similar to this patient. ALS also typically manifests around 50–70 years of age. However, manifestations of ALS are usually asymmetric, whereas this patient has symmetric findings. Moreover, sensory loss and neck pain are not common in ALS.

**E - Cavitation of the cervical spinal cord** - Cavitation of the cervical spinal cord occurs in syringomyelia, which can manifest with radiating neck pain, decreased muscle strength, and hyporeflexia in a “cape-like” distribution (i.e., neck, shoulders, upper limbs). Moreover, an expanded syrinx can cause hyperreflexia in the lower extremities, as seen in this patient. However, affected individuals classically have dissociated sensory impairment with loss of pain and temperature sensation (due to damage to the crossing spinothalamic tracts) and intact fine touch sensation, unlike the findings seen in this patient. This patient's history of chronic neck pain makes a different underlying cause much more likely.

**F - Postinfectious demyelinating reaction** - A postinfectious demyelinating reaction can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which can manifest with symmetric paresthesias and muscle weakness in the upper extremities. However, patients with GBS typically present with an ascending flaccid paralysis in a “stocking-glove” distribution, which is not seen here. Moreover, findings of upper motor neuron injury (e.g., hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) in the lower extremities are not expected in GBS.
