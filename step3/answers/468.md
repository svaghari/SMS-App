### ** Correct Answer: **

**A - Calcitonin** - Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm of the parafollicular cells (C cells) that often arises sporadically but is also associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and type 2B (MEN2). Since parafollicular cells produce the hormone calcitonin, increased serum calcitonin would be expected. Measuring the serum calcitonin concentration is helpful to support the diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma and is also used to monitor for residual disease or recurrence after thyroidectomy.

** Other Answers: **

**B - Gastrin** - Increased serum gastrin would be seen in gastrinoma, which is a feature of MEN1, not MEN2. MEN1 would also manifest with primary hyperparathyroidism and/or pituitary adenomas, not with pheochromocytoma. Furthermore, gastrinomas are located mainly in the duodenum or pancreas and would therefore neither cause a swelling on the right side of the neck nor a nodule in the thyroid lobe. Finally, symptoms of gastrinoma such as treatment-resistant peptic ulcer disease and diarrhea are not seen in this patient.

**C - Metanephrines** - Increased serum metanephrines would be seen in pheochromocytoma, which is a feature of MEN2. However, the patient was already operated on for a pheochromocytoma, and the recent findings are consistent with medullary thyroid carcinoma, which would not result in an increase in serum metanephrines.

**D - Thyroid-stimulating hormone** - Medullary thyroid carcinoma does not lead to increased serum TSH. Increased serum TSH can be seen in primary hypothyroidism or central hyperthyroidism. However, this patient has no symptoms of hypothyroidism (e.g., weight gain, constipation, fatigue) or hyperthyroidism (e.g., weight loss, diarrhea, restlessness). Also, MEN2 is not commonly associated with dysfunction of the thyroid gland.

**E - Parathyroid hormone** - Increased serum PTH would indicate hyperparathyroidism, which is a feature of MEN2 A in 20â€“30% of cases. However, the patient shows no symptoms of hyperparathyroidism (e.g., nephrolithiasis, bone, muscle, and joint pain, peptic ulcer disease, or depression). Additionally, a firm, irregular thyroid nodule is more suggestive of a malignancy of the thyroid gland, which does not increase serum PTH.
