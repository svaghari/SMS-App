### ** Correct Answer: **

**D - Administer IV methylprednisolone** - The first-line management for MS exacerbation is high-dose IV glucocorticoids, e.g., methylprednisolone. 500–1000 mg should be given daily for 3–5 days. Steroids should be tapered when symptoms improve. As in any patient taking high-dose steroids, a proton pump inhibitor should be given concurrently to prevent gastritis and low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis. (See table “Summary of multiple sclerosis therapy”)

Question Difficulty: 1

** Other Answers: **

**A - Dimethyl fumarate therapy** - Dimethyl fumarate is an immunomodulator that is used in disease-modifying MS therapy, particularly for patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Although this patient will likely ultimately be placed on disease-modifying therapy such as dimethyl fumarate, she first requires treatment for her acute exacerbation.

**B - Interferon beta therapy** - Interferon beta is an immunomodulator and a first-line agent for disease-modifying MS therapy, which helps prevent (not treat) exacerbations. Although this patient will likely ultimately be placed on disease-modifying therapy such as interferon beta, she first requires treatment for her acute exacerbation.

**C - Administer lorazepam** - Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that is often administered in patients in status epilepticus or seizure activity lasting > 5 minutes. Patients with epilepsy can have recurring seizure episodes and sometimes postictal paralysis (i.e.,Todd's paralysis). However, Todd's paralysis typically resolves within 48 hours and this patient has no evidence of seizure (e.g., convulsions). Finally, seizure would be unlikely to cause this patient's self-resolving visual symptoms.

**E - Plasmapheresis** - Plasmapheresis is the second-line treatment for acute MS exacerbations. If this patient had contraindications to or failed first-line treatment, then plasmapheresis would be an appropriate treatment.

**F - Administer tissue plasminogen activator** - Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is used for thrombolysis and is administered in patients who present within 4.5 hours of developing signs of a stroke without evidence of hemorrhage on a brain CT. Although strokes often present with unilateral weakness, this patient's symptoms have persisted for two days with her prior episode resolving after one week, which is outside the range both for a suspected stroke and for utility in administration of tPA. In addition, a typical stroke patient is elderly with known risk factors (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, smoking).

**G - Glatiramer acetate therapy** - Glatiramer acetate is a pharmacologic option for disease-modifying MS therapy, which helps prevent (not treat) exacerbations. Although this patient will likely be placed on disease-modifying therapy such as glatiramer in the long run, she first requires treatment for her acute exacerbation.
