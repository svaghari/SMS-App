### ** Correct Answer: **

**B - Interstitial lung disease** - This patient with ARDS is at increased risk for interstitial lung disease. ARDS is characterized by damage to capillaries and epithelial cells in the lungs, which causes exudation of protein-rich fluid into the alveolar space and the formation of hyaline membranes. This results in diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which is repaired by proliferation of type II pneumocytes and infiltration of fibroblasts, ultimately leading to progressive interstitial fibrosis and restrictive lung disease.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Pulmonary embolism** - Pulmonary embolism commonly develops in patients with ARDS during the hospitalization period. It is primarily caused by immobilization, stasis of blood, and endothelial damage, which can activate the coagulation cascade. However, pulmonary embolism is not considered a long-term complication of ARDS.

**C - Spontaneous pneumothorax** - Iatrogenic (not spontaneous) pneumothorax may occur acutely as a complication of mechanical ventilation for the treatment of ARDS but would not be expected two weeks after treatment. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs most commonly with obstructive lung disease (e.g., emphysema-predominant COPD).

**D - Panacinar emphysema** - Panacinar (panlobular) emphysema is associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency, which is characterized by destruction of the entire acinus. α1-antitrypsin deficiency usually affects the lower lobes and results in increased pulmonary compliance and obstructive lung disease. It is not a complication of ARDS.

**E - Asthma** - Asthma is a reversible obstructive lung disease that is triggered by exposure to allergens, GERD, cold air, and exercise. Auscultatory findings in patients with asthma typically include diffuse wheezing rather than the bibasilar crackles seen here. Asthma is not a complication of ARDS.
