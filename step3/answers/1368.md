### ** Correct Answer: **

**C - Administer intravenous fluids** - In a catheterized patient with postoperative oliguria and azotemia, the next best step is to administer intravenous crystalloid fluids (lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline). Decreased renal perfusion due to hypovolemia (from intraoperative hemorrhage or insensible fluid losses) and renal afferent arteriole constriction (from intraoperative catecholamine surge and increased sympathetic tone) is responsible for most cases of postoperative oliguria. Increasing intravascular fluid volume via a fluid challenge will increase renal perfusion and thereby reverse these processes.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Administer intravenous furosemide** - Furosemide can be used in patients with acute kidney injury with signs of volume overload. This patient, however, does not have peripheral edema or evidence of pulmonary edema to suggest fluid overload. In patients with acute kidney injury but no evidence of fluid overload, diuretics have no benefit and can even be detrimental.

**B - Start ciprofloxacin** - Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, would be indicated if a urinary tract infection (UTI) were suspected. UTI is an important etiology to consider in a hospitalized patient with oliguria who has undergone recent instrumentation (foley catheter placement). However, this patient does not have any other symptoms consistent with UTI.

**D - Obtain an abdominal CT** - An abdominal CT would be indicated if intra-abdominal bleeding is suspected. Significant intra-abdominal hemorrhage can cause oliguria and prerenal azotemia. However, the absence of tachycardia and/or hypotension make intra-abdominal hemorrhage very unlikely. An abdominal CT would also be indicated if a deep surgical site infection (e.g., bacterial peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess) or anastomotic leak were suspected. These could both cause decrease in urine output. However, other features such as tachycardia, hypotension, and/or fever would also be expected.

**E - Administer tamsulosin** - Tamsulosin is used to prevent or correct urinary retention in patients who have benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Patients with BPH are at risk of developing postoperative urinary retention (POUR), which can cause oliguria in a non-catheterized patient. This patient, however, has already been catheterized.

**F - Place a suprapubic catheter** - A suprapubic catheter would be indicated if the patient had postoperative urinary retention (POUR), failed a voiding trial, and could not be catheterized (e.g., due to severe prostatic enlargement). However, this patient has already been successfully catheterized and has no evidence of obstruction. Suprapubic catheterization confers no advantage in this scenario.

**G - Perform urgent abdominal re-exploration** - Re-exploration would be indicated if this patient had features of hypovolemic shock (e.g., sudden deterioration, new-onset hypotension, poor peripheral pulses) or intra-abdominal hemorrhage was strongly suspected. This patient is hemodynamically stable without signs of symptoms concerning for acute intra-abdominal pathology.
