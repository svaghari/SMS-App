### ** Correct Answer: **

**J - Salmonella typhi** - Salmonella typhi is most likely to have caused this patient's symptoms, who has recently traveled to an endemic region. Typhoid infection is characterized by a fluctuating fever and malaise followed by profound fatigue, high fever, and relative bradycardia. Initial constipation can be followed by profuse diarrhea (pea-soup diarrhea), a salmon-colored maculopapular rash (rose spots), and hepatosplenomegaly, usually in the second week after onset. Salmonella typhi is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, with the bacteria initially entering the host through intestinal Peyer patches. After a period of replication, the organism enters the bloodstream and can seed several organs (e.g., the liver and spleen).

Treatment with a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) or a fluoroquinolone is indicated. The WHO recommends typhoid fever vaccination, which contains the Vi capsular polysaccharide antigen, to those traveling to high-risk areas (East and Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa).

** Other Answers: **

**A - Giardia lamblia** - Giardia lamblia causes giardiasis, which is characterized by bloating, flatulence, and foul-smelling, fatty, frothy diarrhea. The causal organism is usually transmitted through contaminated water, and affected patients usually have a recent history of camping or exposure to fresh water. Fever, rash, and constitutional symptoms are not common features.

**B - Yersinia enterocolitica** - Yersinia enterocolitica causes diarrhea and usually appears after ingestion of spoiled meat. Patients typically present with low-grade fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea; the diarrhea may be bloody in some cases, and the duration of symptoms is variable. Patients may also develop symptoms that mimic appendicitis (pseudoappendicitis). While this patient does have fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly and a salmon-colored rash are not features of Yersinia infection, making this diagnosis unlikely.

**C - Schistosoma mansoni** - Schistosoma mansoni causes schistosomiasis. In the acute period, infection may cause pruritus, but it is most commonly asymptomatic. Chronically infected patients sometimes develop episodic fever and malaise that may be accompanied by abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, dysuria, hematochezia, and/or hematuria. This patient's relatively acute onset of symptoms and the presence of a faint salmon-colored maculopapular rash are not consistent with this diagnosis. Furthermore, Schistosoma mansoni is usually found in Africa and South America, not in Indonesia.

**D - Entamoeba histolytica** - Entamoeba histolytica causes amebiasis, which can manifest in a variety of symptoms depending on the severity of illness. Mild infections may take the form of loose stools and vague abdominal pain, whereas severe infections involve a dysentery-like syndrome characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. In the setting of amebic liver abscess, hepatosplenomegaly may be present, along with significant right upper quadrant pain. However, a rash would not be expected in amebiasis, making this diagnosis much less likely.

**E - Escherichia coli** - Escherichia coli causes a spectrum of clinical entities that depend on the causative strain. Enteroinvasive E. coli causes a dysentery-like illness, with fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Enterotoxigenic E. coli causes traveler's diarrhea, which is characterized by watery diarrhea, with minimal constitutional symptoms. E. coli infections would not typically cause a rash or fluctuating fever.

**F - Clostridioides difficile** - Clostridioides difficile causes pseudomembranous colitis, which is often considered a nosocomial infection, as it is strongly associated with recent broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure. Mild infections can manifest with bloody diarrhea alone, while more severe infections manifest with dysentery, crampy abdominal pain, and fever. However, this patient has no history of recent antibiotic use, and a rash and hepatosplenomegaly would not be expected in C. difficile infection, making this diagnosis unlikely.

**G - Cryptosporidium parvum** - Cryptosporidium parvum causes a form of self-limiting traveler's diarrhea in immunocompetent patients, with loose, profound watery stools and minimal constitutional symptoms. In immunosuppressed patients (classically patients with AIDS), it can cause potentially life-threatening diarrhea. The high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and rash seen in this patient would not be consistent with this diagnosis.

**H - Campylobacter jejuni** - Campylobacter jejuni is associated with a dysentery-like illness, with fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. It is a common cause of bloody diarrhea in children and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, contaminated food products (such as poultry or unpasteurized milk), and infected animals. Rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and profuse, watery diarrhea are not associated features.

**I - Shigella dysenteriae** - Shigella dysenteriae causes shigellosis, which is characterized by high fever, cramping abdominal pain, and bloody mucoid diarrhea. The progression of illness is more rapid, and the diarrhea is rarely profuse. There would be no associated rash, as seen in this patient.

**K - Clostridium perfringens** - Clostridium perfringens is a common cause of food poisoning and manifests with self-limiting abdominal cramping, diarrhea, vomiting, and fever several hours after ingesting tainted food. Infection usually resolves within 24 hours and does not present with a rash or hepatosplenomegaly, making the diagnosis extremely unlikely in this patient.

**L - Vibrio cholerae** - Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera, is associated with profuse, watery diarrhea (rice-water stools), which can lead to severe dehydration and death. Affected patients usually have a history of consuming raw or undercooked seafood. The onset is rapid, with no prodrome of constipation, rash, or hepatosplenomegaly.
