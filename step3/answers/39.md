### ** Correct Answer: **

**F - Continue fluoxetine and add phenelzine** - It would be inappropriate to continue fluoxetine and add a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), such as phenelzine, at this time. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are particularly effective at treating symptoms of atypical depression (↑ appetite, weight gain, and ↑ sleep). However, they are contraindicated in patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Antidepressants should be discontinued at least 2 weeks before initiating therapy with MAOIs. Fluoxetine should be discontinued at least 5 weeks before initiating MAOIs. MAOIs are considered a third- or fourth-line therapy due to their numerous drug interactions and associated hypertensive crisis with ingestion of foods containing tyramine (e.g., aged cheese, salami, wine).
