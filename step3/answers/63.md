### ** Correct Answer: **

**A - Heroin** - This patient has classic signs and symptoms of heroin withdrawal (opioid withdrawal), which include flu-like symptoms (e.g., rhinorrhea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, leg cramps), features of sympathetic hyperactivity (e.g., tachycardia, mydriasis, hyperreflexia), CNS stimulation (e.g., yawning, irritability), and cool, damp skin with piloerection.

Question Difficulty: 1

** Other Answers: **

**B - Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid** - Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid withdrawal can cause features of CNS stimulation (e.g., irritability, insomnia) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, abdominal pain), which are seen in this patient. However, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid withdrawal usually also causes tremors and increased muscle tone. Moreover, it would not cause mydriasis or piloerection.

**C - Methamphetamine** - Methamphetamine withdrawal resembles the features of major depressive disorder (e.g., insomnia or hypersomnia, anhedonia, appetite changes, lack of energy/motivation, and depressed mood). It does not cause leg cramping, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, yawning, tachycardia, piloerection, or mydriasis.

**D - Barbiturate** - Barbiturate withdrawal can cause CNS stimulation (e.g., insomnia, irritability) and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., tachycardia, diarrhea), which are seen in this patient. However, barbiturate withdrawal usually also causes tremors, dysphoria, delirium, and seizures. It can also manifest with life-threatening cardiovascular dysfunction. Barbiturate withdrawal does not cause rhinorrhea, mydriasis, or piloerection.

**E - Alcohol** - Patients in the early phase of alcohol withdrawal (3–36 hours after last drink) can present with irritability, insomnia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. However, most patients at this stage also develop tremors, which are not seen in this patient. Symptoms can progress to brief tonic-clonic seizures (6–48 hours after last drink), alcoholic hallucinosis (12–48 hours after last drink), and, if left untreated, delirium tremens (48–96 hours after last drink). Alcohol withdrawal does not cause rhinorrhea or piloerection.

**F - Cannabis** - Cannabis withdrawal can cause irritability and tachycardia, which are seen in this patient. However, cannabis withdrawal usually also causes additional mood dysfunction (e.g., depression, anxiety), insomnia, and a decreased appetite and would not cause rhinorrhea, mydriasis, leg cramping, diarrhea, hyperreflexia, or piloerection.

**G - Cocaine** - Cocaine withdrawal causes a physiological crash characterized by anhedonia, lack of energy/motivation, psychomotor agitation, miosis, vivid dreams, increased appetite, and depressed mood. It does not cause sympathetic hyperactivity (e.g., tachycardia, mydriasis, hyperreflexia), CNS stimulation (e.g., yawning, irritability), or piloerection.
