### ** Correct Answer: **

**C - C** - This ABG analysis suggests an uncompensated respiratory acidosis. Decreased pH indicates acidosis, while increased pCO2 suggests a respiratory source (e.g., respiratory depression from opioid overdose, as seen in this patient). Because of the acute nature, minimal metabolic compensation would be expected [consistent with a normal bicarbonate (HCO3-)]. Differential diagnoses for acute, uncompensated respiratory acidosis include obstructive sleep apnea, foreign body aspiration, and neuromuscular etiologies (e.g., Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, myasthenia gravis, botulism).

** Other Answers: **

**A - A** - This ABG analysis is consistent with a combined respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. Decreased pH indicates acidosis, while increased pCO2 suggests a respiratory source. However, the bicarbonate (HCO3-) is elevated beyond what would be expected by physiologic compensation alone, thus also suggesting a primary metabolic alkalosis, as could be seen in a patient with pulmonary edema being treated with a diuretic agent. Although this patient presents with respiratory depression, there is no history to suggest a primary metabolic derangement.

**B - B** - This ABG analysis is consistent with primary metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation. Increased pH indicates alkalosis, while the increased bicarbonate (HCO3-) suggests a metabolic source (vomiting, NG suction, diuretic use). Appropriate respiratory compensation via hypoventilation results in an elevated pCO2. Although this patient presents with hypoventilation, there is no history to suggest a primary metabolic derangement.

**D - D** - This ABG analysis is consistent with uncompensated respiratory alkalosis. Increased pH indicates alkalosis, while the decreased pCO2 suggests a respiratory source (e.g., hyperventilation during a panic attack or in early salicylate overdose). Normal bicarbonate (HCO3-) indicates an acute scenario with negligent metabolic compensation. Although this patient does present with respiratory abnormality, his shallow respirations at 5/min indicate hypoventilation, as opposed to hyperventilation.

**E - E** - This ABG analysis suggests a combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis, which can occur in cardiopulmonary arrest. Decreased pH indicates acidosis, while reduced bicarbonate (HCO3-) suggests a metabolic source. This pCO2 is higher than would be expected with respiratory compensation (by Winter formula), and therefore a primary respiratory acidosis is also expected. Although respiratory derangements would be expected as a result of this patient's opioid overdose, metabolic acid-base changes would be unlikely.
