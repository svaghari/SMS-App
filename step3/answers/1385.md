### ** Correct Answer: **

**D - Amlodipine** - Amlodipine, had it been administered to lower the patient's blood pressure, would have been most likely to delay the progression of her diabetic nephropathy. This patient's blood pressure reading of 152/98 mm Hg suggests that her blood pressure is not optimally controlled and her worsening microalbuminuria indicates worsening nephropathy. ACE inhibitors remain the first-line therapy in diabetic patients with hypertension, as they have been shown to prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy. However, in patients already on an ACE inhibitor, such as this one, the addition of a second antihypertensive agent (e.g., a calcium channel blocker) would have been most appropriate.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Losartan** - Losartan and other angiotensin receptor blockers are effective in delaying the progression of nephropathy in diabetic patients. However, they do not have an additive protective effect when combined with ACE inhibitors. Administering losartan to a patient who is already taking lisinopril would, in fact, increase the risk of acute kidney injury. Losartan would therefore not have been likely to prevent this patient's worsening renal function.

**B - Aspirin** - Aspirin would be indicated for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in this patient given her risk factors of diabetes mellitus, age, microalbuminuria, and hypertension. However, aspirin does not delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

**C - Atorvastatin** - Statins are recommended in all diabetic patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (as is the case here), as they help reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. However, statins do not delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

**E - Insulin** - Glycemic control is important in delaying the progression of diabetic nephropathy. However, this patient's diabetes is well controlled on metformin, as evidenced by her hemoglobin A1c < 6.5%. The addition of insulin would not have prevented this patient's worsening renal function.
