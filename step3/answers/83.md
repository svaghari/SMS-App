### ** Correct Answer: **

**G - Factitious disorder imposed on another** - Factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA) is a psychiatric condition in which an individual intentionally falsifies manifestations of disease in another individual (e.g., their child or elderly dependent) for primary gain. This boy's mother, who has type 2 diabetes mellitus, has given him exogenous insulin, which causes hyperinsulinemia, hypoglycemic episodes, and decreased serum C-peptide concentrations (because exogenous insulin does not contain C-peptide). The primary gain in this scenario includes the attention, sympathy, and care given to sick patients and their families.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Malingering** - Malingering is the intentional falsification of symptoms and/or diagnoses for secondary gain (e.g., financial incentive, time off work). This boy has received exogenous insulin, which causes hyperinsulinemia, hypoglycemic episodes, and decreased serum C-peptide concentrations (because exogenous insulin does not contain C-peptide). However, malingering is not the most likely diagnosis in this scenario because it is very unlikely that this 5-year-old boy has the capability or motivation to seek secondary gain.

**B - Glucagonoma** - A glucagonoma is a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that produces excess glucagon, which results in hyperglycemia (not hypoglycemia). In addition, this patient does not have other typical manifestations of a glucagonoma, which include necrolytic migratory erythema, venous thromboembolic conditions, weight loss, and neuropsychiatric changes (e.g., depression, psychosis). Moreover, this tumor is rare and typically develops in adulthood.

**C - Primary adrenal insufficiency** - Primary adrenal insufficiency can cause hypoglycemic episodes as a result of decreased glucose production due to glucocorticoid deficiency. However, this patient does not have other manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency, which include gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting), fatigue, hypotension, dizziness, and skin hyperpigmentation. Moreover, primary adrenal insufficiency does not cause hyperinsulinemia or decreased serum C-peptide concentrations.

**D - Insulinoma** - An insulinoma is a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that produces excess insulin, which results in hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemic episodes. However, endogenous insulin production causes increased (not decreased) serum C-peptide concentrations. Moreover, this tumor is rare and typically develops in adulthood.

**E - Conversion disorder** - Conversion disorder is a somatic symptom disorder characterized by significant distress and/or psychosocial impairment caused by neurologic symptoms (e.g., paralysis, weakness, visual disturbances) that cannot be fully attributed to another condition. This patient has episodic loss of consciousness, but these symptoms are caused by his hypoglycemic episodes.

**F - Somatostatinoma** - A somatostatinoma is a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that produces excess somatostatin, which results in decreased secretion of several hormones, including insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone. This patient has hyperinsulinemia, not hypoinsulinemia. In addition, this patient does not have typical manifestations of a somatostatinoma, which include abdominal pain, weight loss, and hyperglycemic episodes (not hypoglycemic episodes). Moreover, this tumor is rare and typically develops in adulthood.
