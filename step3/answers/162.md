### ** Correct Answer: **

**C - 101 mg/dL** - To determine the median, the data set must be arranged in ascending order. The values of this set, in ascending order, are 90, 95, 100, 100, 102, 105, 109, 119. Since there is an even number of values in the set, the median is the average of the two middle values (i.e., (100 + 102)/2 = 101).

** Other Answers: **

**A - 100 mg/dL** - 100 mg/dL is the mode of this data set, which is the most common value in the data set.

**B - 102.5 mg/dL** - 102.5 mg/dL is the mean of the data set, which is the arithmetic average of the data set (i.e., (90 + 100 + 102 + 119 + 95 + 105 + 109 + 100)/8 = 102.5).

**D - 29 mg/dL** - 29 mg/dL is the range of this data set, which is the difference between the largest and smallest value in the set, and is calculated as 119 – 90 = 29.

**E - 10 mg/dL** - 10 mg/dL is the interquartile range of this data set, which is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile and is calculated as 105 – 95 = 10.
