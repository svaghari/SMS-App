### ** Correct Answer: **

**E - 20** - If the population is in a steady state, the relationship between incidence rate (IR), prevalence (P), and the average duration of the disease (T) can be described mathematically as P/(1-P) = IR x T. Since the average duration of the disease is 25 years and the prevalence is 0.2, the incidence rate is about 0.01 per year. The predicted number of new cases of fasting hyperglycemia after one year would, therefore, be IR × population at risk = 0.01 × (2540 - 510) ≈ 20 cases.
