### ** Correct Answer: **

**B - 10** - The absolute risk reduction in this study is the risk in the placebo group, 350 / (350 + 1050) = 0.25, minus the risk in the losartan group, 300 / (300 + 1200) = 0.20. Thus, the ARR = 0.25 - 0.20 = 0.05. Therefore, the number needed to treat is 1/0.05 = 20 patients. This means that for every 20 patients treated, one death will be prevented. For every 200 patients treated, 10 deaths will be prevented.

** Other Answers: **

**A - 20** - This value is the number needed to treat, which is calculated by taking the inverse of the ARR. In this study, the ARR is the risk in the placebo group, 350 / (350 + 1050) = 0.25, minus the risk in the losartan group, 300 / (300 + 1200) = 0.20. Thus, the ARR = 0.25 - 0.20 = 0.05. The NNT is therefore 1/0.05 = 20 patients. However, the question asks how many deaths will be prevented if 200 patients with congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction < 30% were treated with losartan in addition to an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker.

**C - 0.25** - This value is the risk of cardiovascular death in the placebo group, which is calculated by dividing the number of deaths in the placebo group by the number at risk in the placebo group: 350 / (350 + 1050) = 0.25.

**D - 50** - This value is the difference in the number of cardiovascular deaths in the placebo group (350) and the losartan group (300). This does not relate to the number of deaths that would be prevented if 200 patients with congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction < 30% were treated with losartan in addition to an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker.

**E - 0.05** - This value is the absolute risk reduction. In this study, the ARR is the risk in the placebo group, 350 / (350 + 1050) = 0.25, minus the risk in the losartan group, 300 / (300 + 1200) = 0.20. Thus, the ARR = 0.25 - 0.20 = 0.05.
