### ** Correct Answer: **

**E - Esophagus** - Because the posterior mediastinal portion of the esophagus lies just behind the left atrium, it is at risk of being compressed and/or displaced by an enlarged left atrium. Left atrial enlargement due to increased left atrial pressure can develop in patients with chronic mitral stenosis, like this patient, although this occurs very rarely.

** Other Answers: **

**A - Trachea** - The trachea terminates by bifurcating into the right and left bronchi superior to the left atrium. Therefore, cardiac compression of the trachea is unlikely.

**B - Thoracic duct** - The thoracic duct lies in the posterior mediastinum and is separated from the heart by the descending thoracic aorta and the esophagus. It is therefore unlikely to be compressed by cardiac enlargement.

**C - Vagus nerve** - The vagus nerves lie posterior to the hila of the lungs bilaterally. They are therefore unlikely to be compressed by cardiac enlargement. In rare cases, compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve by a significantly enlarged left atrium may occur in patients with chronic mitral stenosis. Patients may then present with hoarseness of voice.

**D - Hemiazygos vein** - The hemiazygos vein lies in the posterior mediastinum, which is separated from the heart by the descending thoracic aorta and the esophagus. It is therefore unlikely to be compressed by cardiac enlargement.
