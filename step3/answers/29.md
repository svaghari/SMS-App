**C - Delusions** - A delusion is a disturbance of thought content that is characterized by a fixed, false belief that is not derived from the individual's cultural or religious beliefs and cannot be changed by reasoning. This patient has a 6-week history of persecutory delusions and delusions of reference but functions normally at work and has no other psychotic symptoms. This is characteristic of delusional disorder. Delusions can also occur in patients with psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, mood disorder with psychotic features), and substance use disorders. Other types of delusions include delusions of grandeur, delusions of control, delusions of guilt, erotomaniac delusions, and somatic delusions.
