### ** Correct Answer: **

**B - Intravenous clindamycin and oral primaquine** - IV clindamycin and oral primaquine are the first-line treatment for patients with PCP who are allergic to sulfa drugs and therefore cannot be given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Question Difficulty: 5

** Other Answers: **

**A - Intravenous fluconazole** - Fluconazole is not effective against Pneumocystis jirovecii, the causative organism of PCP, because this fungus contains cholesterol instead of ergosterol in its cell membrane.

**C - Intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole** - TMP-SMX is first-line treatment of PCP, but this patient is allergic to sulfa drugs. Since sulfamethoxazole is a sulfa drug, the combination of TMP-SMX is contraindicated in this patient.

**D - Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin** - Ceftriaxone and azithromycin are antibiotics empirically chosen to treat severe community-acquired pneumonia that requires hospitalization. They are not effective against Pneumocystis jirovecii, which is the causative organism of PCP.

**E - Intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and oral prednisone** - Although TMP-SMX is a first-line treatment for PCP, it is contraindicated in this patient because she is allergic to sulfa drugs. Glucocorticoids are added to treat PCP in the case of respiratory insufficiency (PaO2 < 70 mm, arterialâ€‘alveolar oxygen gradient > 35, or room air oxygen saturation < 92%).
