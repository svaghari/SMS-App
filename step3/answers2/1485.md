### ** Correct Answer: **

**A - Albuterol inhaler** - Albuterol is an inhaled, short-acting β2-adrenergic agonist and is the drug of choice for acute treatment of asthma symptoms. Patients who have intermittent attacks, in which the trigger of asthmatic symptoms is known and can be predicted (e.g., exercise-induced bronchoconstriction), can also use a short-acting inhaled β2-agonist as a prophylactic measure ∼ 10 minutes before the triggering event (e.g., exercise). According to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP), the low frequency of symptom occurrence associated with intermittent asthma only requires symptomatic treatment for acute exacerbations, whereas more severe forms of asthma require a constant therapeutic regimen to prevent exacerbations. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), however, differs in its recommendations for intermittent asthma: long-term management includes an inhaled corticosteroid-containing controller inhaler for every adult and adolescent with asthma, in addition to formoterol or a short-acting β2-agonist as needed.

** Other Answers: **

**B - Fluticasone inhaler** - Fluticasone, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), can be used as an asthma controller in the management of mild, moderate, and persistent asthma. Over time, it reduces the frequency of symptoms as well as the severity of each subsequent exacerbation. However, ICS-only treatment is not effective for relieving acute asthma symptoms because of its late onset of action; it is typically given in combination with short-acting or long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, leukotriene-receptor antagonists, or muscarinic antagonists.

**C - Oral montelukast sodium** - Oral montelukast, a leukotriene-receptor antagonist, can be used as an asthma controller for the prevention of acute exacerbations of persistent asthma when a noncorticosteroid therapeutic alternative is desired. However, this class of drug is ineffective as an asthma reliever, and it would not be considered in this patient with intermittent asthma before other preferred controller medications.

**D - Cromolyn sodium inhaler** - Cromolyn sodium, a mast cell stabilizer, is used in bronchial asthma as a non-corticosteroid therapeutic alternative for long-term control of persistent asthma. It has no significant efficacy in controlling acute exacerbations.

**E - Mometasone inhaler and oral zafirlukast** - An inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., mometasone) in combination with a leukotriene-receptor antagonist (e.g., zafirlukast) can be used as an alternative regimen as an asthma controller for the prevention of acute exacerbations in patients with moderate to persistent asthma. However, this combination of drugs is not effective in relieving acute asthma symptoms and would therefore not be appropriate in this patient with intermittent asthma.

**F - Salmeterol inhaler** - Salmeterol, a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist (LABA), can be used in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid for the prevention of acute exacerbations (i.e., asthma controller) in patients with moderate to persistent asthma. However, LABA-only treatment is not recommended in any class of asthma severity.
