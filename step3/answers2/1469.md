### ** Correct Answer: **

**D - In-laboratory polysomnography** - In-laboratory polysomnography is considered the gold-standard diagnostic test for OSA. Diagnostic polysomnography is preferred over home testing particularly in patients with suspected complicated OSA, such as this patient with coexisting heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Polysomnography typically demonstrates apnea and hypopnea events, oxygen desaturation, arousal events on EEG, bradycardia, and fragmentation of sleep. Once diagnosed, additional polysomnography testing determines CPAP parameters for treatment.

** Other Answers: **

**A - ENT evaluation** - An ENT evaluation for low-lying palate may eventually be helpful in treating this patient's OSA with upper airway surgery. However, it would not be the most appropriate next step in management, which should include confirmatory diagnostic testing and evaluation for more conservative treatment such as CPAP.

**B - Overnight pulse oximetry** - Overnight pulse oximetry can measure desaturation events, which do commonly occur in patients with OSA. However, overnight pulse oximetry alone cannot confirm the diagnosis or guide management.

**C - Home sleep apnea testing** - Home sleep apnea testing is appropriate for patients with suspected uncomplicated OSA. However, it is inappropriate in a patient with known heart failure and atrial fibrillation.

**E - Echocardiography** - Echocardiography can demonstrate structural or functional cardiac defects. This patient has known heart failure and reports poor sleep, which could also be due to paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. However, his exam did not demonstrate lung crackles, lower extremity edema, or an S3, making heart failure exacerbation an unlikely diagnosis.
