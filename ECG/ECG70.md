#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

There are multiple features suggestive of right ventricular hypertrophy or RV strain:
* Right axis deviation
* Dominant R wave in V1
* Right bundle branch block
* Right ventricular strain pattern — T wave inversions in V1-4, lead III
* SI QIII TIII  pattern
* Clockwise rotation of the heart, with a persistent S wave in V6 

Given the clinical history, the most likely scenario is acute right heart strain due to massive pulmonary embolism.

A similar ECG pattern may also be seen with chronic cor pulmonale, pulmonary hypertension or RV hypertrophy (e.g. due to congenital heart disease).

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

ECG changes in pulmonary embolism include:
* Sinus tachycardia – the most common abnormality; seen in 44% of patients. 
* Complete or incomplete RBBB – associated with increased mortality; seen in 18% of patients. 
* Right ventricular strain pattern –  T wave inversions in the right precordial leads (V1-4) ± the inferior leads (II, III, aVF). This pattern is seen in up to 34% of patients and is associated with high pulmonary artery pressures. 
* Right axis deviation – seen in 16% of patients. Extreme right axis deviation may occur, with axis between zero and -90 degrees, giving the appearance of left axis deviation (“pseudo left axis”). 
* Dominant R wave in V1 – a manifestation of acute right ventricular dilatation. 
* Right atrial enlargement (P pulmonale) – peaked P wave in lead II > 2.5 mm in height. Seen in 9% of patients. 
* SI QIII TIII  pattern – deep S wave in lead I, Q wave in III, inverted T wave in III. This “classic” finding is neither sensitive nor specific for pulmonary embolism; found in only 20% of patients with PE. 
* Clockwise rotation – shift of the R/S transition point towards V6 with a persistent S wave in V6 (“pulmonary disease pattern”), implying rotation of the heart due to right ventricular dilatation. 
* Atrial tachyarrhythmias – AF, flutter, atrial tachycardia. Seen in 8% of patients.
* Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes, including ST elevation and depression. Reported in up to 50% of patients with PE. 

Simultaneous T wave inversions in the inferior (II, III, aVF) and right precordial leads (V1-4) is the most specific finding in favour of PE.
