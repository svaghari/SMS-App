ECG ANSWER 81 - ECG 3

The episode of pain lasted only several minutes and resolved spontaneously. This ECG was taken 8 minutes after the second ECG with the patient now pain free.

Rate:
* 66 

Rhythm:
* Regular 
* Sinus rhythm 

Axis:
* Borderline LAD (~ -30 deg) 

Intervals:
* PR – Normal (~180ms) 
* QRS – Normal (80ms) 
* QT – 380ms (QTc Bazett ~ 410 ms) 

Segments:
* ST elevation leads III, aVFReduced compered with ECG 2

**INTERPRETATION**

ECG series showing ischaemia with re-perfusion (ECG 1), subsequent re-occlusion (ECG 2) with infero-postero-lateral STEMI, and spontaneous re-perfusion (ECG 3).

---------------

**OUTCOME**

The patient was immediately discussed with cardiology services. Treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and placed on a heparin infusion and admitted to CCU. The patient remained pain free, troponin peaked at 12 hours, 4.8 (normal <0.05), and the patient was transfer the next day for angiography. 

The angio showed:
* Right coronary: 98% stenosis –> stented 
* Circumflex: 80% stenosis 
* Left anterior descending: 80% proximal stenosis 
* Left main: 20% proximal stenosis 
* Left ventricle: Inferior hypokinesis with normal LV function
