#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

* ST depression in V2-5, which slopes upwards and joins the ascending limb of the T wave. 
* Prominent, “rocket-shaped” T waves in the precordial leads V2-5. 
* Subtle ST elevation in aVR. 

**Diagnosis**

* This combination of ST depression with rocket-shaped T waves in the precordial leads V1-6 is referred to as the De Winter ECG pattern or “De Winter T waves”. <https://litfl.com/de-winter-t-wave-ecg-library/>
* It is becoming increasingly recognised as an anterior STEMI equivalent (~2% of LAD occlusions). 
* Some authors are now recommending that this ECG pattern be treated identically to anterior STEMI, with urgent PCI or thrombolysis. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24176590>

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

The De Winter ECG pattern may evolve into (or even evolve from) a more classic STEMI pattern.
