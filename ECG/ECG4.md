#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**
* Broad complex tachycardia, rate ~ 130 bpm. 
* The rhythm is likely sinus tachycardia with a 1st degree AV block — note the “camel hump” appearance to the T waves indicating a hidden P wave.
* Interventricular conduction delay (QRS duration > 100ms, not typical LBBB / RBBB morphology) 
* Right axis deviation.
* Secondary R’ wave in aVR > 3 mm. 

**Diagnosis**

In the context of a patient presenting with seizures and hypotension, the combination of…
* QRS broadening > 100 ms 
* R’ wave in aVR > 3 mm 
… is highly suggestive of poisoning with a sodium-channel blocking agent — e.g. tricyclic antidepressant.
The sinus tachycardia may be due to the anticholinergic effects of the TCA.

**CLINICAL PEARLS**
In the context of sodium channel blockade:
* A QRS duration > 100 ms is predictive of seizures. 
* A QRS duration > 160 ms is predictive of cardiotoxicity. 

This patient is already manifesting life-threatening toxicity and needs aggressive resuscitation, including:
* Serum alkalinisation with NaHCO3 to reverse pH-dependent toxicity. 
* Intubation and hyperventilation aiming for alkaline arterial pH (e.g. 7.45 to 7.55). 
* Seizure management with benzodiazepines. 
* BP management with fluid boluses +/- pressors.
