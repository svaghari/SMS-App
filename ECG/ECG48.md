#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

On first glance this would appear to be SVT with LBBB as there is:
* Regular broad-complex tachycardia. 
* No atrial activity seen. 
* Typical LBBB morphology in aVR, V1 and V6. 
* No obvious diagnostic features for VT — compare this with ECG 047. <https://litfl.com/ecg-case-047/>

However, there is one feature here that is unusual for LBBB, can you spot it?
There is an inferior axis (+90 degrees), which is atypical for Left Bundle branch block. LBBB normally has a leftward axis.

This combination of…
* Broad complex tachycardia with typical LBBB morphology. 
* Inferior axis (+90 degrees). 
… is suggestive of a specific type of VT known as right ventricular outflow-tract tachycardia (RVOT).

RVOT is a relatively common form of right ventricular VT, occurring in two main groups:
* Patients with structurally normal hearts (= 70% of idiopathic VT). 
* Patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

It may be very difficult to differentiate RVOT from SVT with LBBB.
[NB. Left bundle branch block morphology simply indicates that the heart is depolarising from right to left. Hence, similar QRS patterns are seen with LBBB, RVOT and RV-pacing]

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

Tips for Spotting RVOT
* Suspect RVOT when you see LBBB morphology + inferior axis. 
* Record a long rhythm strip looking for fusion and capture beats. 

I have diagnosed this only a couple of times in the past. Each time I had to stand by the monitor with my finger on the “print” button waiting for a fusion or capture beat to appear before anyone would believe me!
