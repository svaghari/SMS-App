#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

* Atrial tachycardia, with regular P waves visible at ~ 160 bpm (many of the P waves are hidden within T waves and VEBs). 
* Evidence of high-grade AV block — there is a 4:1 conduction ratio between P waves and QRS complexes, with a QRS rate of ~ 40 bpm.
* Frequent ventricular ectopic beats occurring in a pattern of ventricular bigeminy. 
* Alternating LBBB and RBBB morphology, with the conducted QRS complexes demonstrating RBBB morphology (RSR’ in V1) and the VEBs demonstrating LBBB morphology (dominant S wave in V1).

**Diagnosis**

The combination of…
* Atrial tachycardia 
* Frequent ventricular ectopic beats 
* High-grade AV block 

… is almost pathognomonic of severe digoxin toxicity.

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

**ECG Features of Digoxin Toxicity**

Digoxin toxicity produces a wide variety of dysrhythmias, due to:
* Increased automaticity of atrial and ventricular tissues — via actions at the Na/K and Na/Ca exchangers causing increased intracellular calcium and therefore increased spontaneous depolarisation of cardiac pacemaker cells. 
* Decreased AV conduction — via increased vagal tone at the AV node. 

Digoxin toxicity therefore usually produces some combination of:
* Increased atrial automaticity — especially atrial tachycardia, but also atrial ectopics, AF, flutter.
* Increased ventricular automaticity — frequent VEBs and bigeminy, polymorphic VT. 
* AV blocks — including 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree AV block.

Characteristic ECG patterns include:
* Atrial tachycardia with high-grade AV block (= the classic dig-toxic rhythm). 
* “Regularised AF” =  AF with complete heart block + accelerated junctional escape rhythm, producing a paradoxically regular rhythm.
* Bidirectional VT = polymorphic VT with QRS complexes that alternate between left- and right-axis-deviation, or between LBBB and RBBB morphology.

NB. Digoxin toxicity should not be confused with digoxin effect (= “sagging” ST depression and T-wave inversion in patients on therapeutic doses of digoxin; not predictive of toxicity).
