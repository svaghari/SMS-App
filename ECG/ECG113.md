**CLINICAL OUTCOME**

What happened?

The patient was taken for urgent PCI which was normal!

He subsequently went on to have a CT brain which showed an extensive subarachnoid haemorrhage.

There are a number of cases in the literature where subarachnoid haemorrhage has been associated with significant ST changes:
