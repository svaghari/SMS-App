#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

This pattern of deeply inverted T waves in the anterolateral leads V2-6, I and aVL is characteristic of Wellens syndrome.

* This ECG pattern is highly predictive of a significant occlusive lesion of the LAD. 
* The inverted T waves are a marker of reperfusion and may occur after an aborted anterior STEMI. 
* Despite often being pain free and having normal cardiac enzymes at presentation, these patients are at risk of sudden LAD re-occlusion leading to massive anterior STEMI and are best managed with early angiography and PCI / CABG.

**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

A similar pattern of deep anterolateral T-wave inversions may also be seen with:
* Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – suspect if associated LVH 
* Raised intracranial pressure – patient will be comatose
