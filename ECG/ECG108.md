#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Key features:**
* Sinus rhythm rate ~90 bpm 
* Left axis deviation 
* RBBB Morphology 
* Prominent T waves and ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V2-5 with high voltage complexesThis ECG was generated using the monitor (non-diagnostic) algorithm. The filter applied in this mode is 0.5 to 40 Hz which can over- or under-estimate low frequency portions of the ECG including the ST segment.The diagnostic algorithm filter performs at 0.05 to 150 Hz.For a somewhat complicated overview of ECG filtering check out:ECG Filters MEDTEQ

* Borderline 1st degree AV block 

Interpretation:
* Bifascicular Block <https://litfl.com/bifascicular-block-ecg-library/>
* Borderline PR prolongation 
* Requires cardiology referral for monitoring and consideration of PPM insertion given history of syncope 
* ST / T wave changes without chest pain or electrolyte abnormality – related to ECG filtering algorithm

Interpretation:
* Compared with rhythm strip above 
* Complete heart block <https://litfl.com/av-block-3rd-degree-complete-heart-block/>
* AV Dissociate with ventricular escape rhythm, rate 24 bpm 
* Slowing of atrial rate now ~115 bpm

**CLINICAL OUTCOME**

What happened next?

The patient was treated with atropine followed by isoprenaline infusion.
The next day he underwent an uneventful dual chamber PPM insertion. A subsequent echo showed was normal with an ejection fraction of 64%.
On review of his medical records prior ECG’s had shown alternating left and right bundle branch blocks confirming progressive conducting system disease.
