#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

This is classic ECG of Wellens syndrome (Pattern A),  demonstrating characteristic biphasic T waves in V1-3.
* This ECG pattern is highly predictive of a significant occlusive lesion of the LAD. 
* The biphasic T waves are a marker of reperfusion and may occur after an aborted anterior STEMI. <https://litfl.com/anterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/>
* Despite often being pain free and having normal cardiac enzymes at presentation, these patients are at risk of sudden LAD re-occlusion leading to massive anterior STEMI and are best managed with early angiography and PCI/CABG.

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

Biphasic T waves may be seen with both Wellens syndrome and hypokalaemia.
The main differentiating factor (apart from the clinical picture) is the direction of the T waves:
* Wellens’ biphasic T waves go UP then down. 
* Hypokalaemic T waves go DOWN then up.
