#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**
* Markedly peaked T waves in V2-6. 
* Extremely short QT interval (~240 ms). 

In a patient presenting with syncope, this ECG pattern is very suspicious for the short QT syndrome.

Short QT Syndrome
* This is a recently-described arrhythmogenic condition associated with paroxysmal atrial and ventricular fibrillation. 
* The hallmark is a significantly shortened QT interval (at least < 360 ms, often < 330 ms) with associated T-wave peaking. 
* SQTS is a genetically-inherited cardiac channelopathy on the same spectrum as other familial arrhythmogenic diseases such as Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), Brugada Syndrome and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic  Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT).

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

When to Suspect SQTS
* Any patient with a QT interval < 330 ms. 
* QT interval < 360 ms and convincing symptoms (syncope, cardiac arrest) or family history. 

Differential Diagnosis
* Peaked T waves and short QT interval may be seen with severe hyperkalaemia.
* A shortened QT interval may also be seen with severe hypercalcaemia.
