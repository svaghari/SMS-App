#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

This is another example of ventricular tachycardia, this time with a dominant S wave in V1/V2 and therefore a LBBB morphology (compare this with ECG 046).

Regular broad complex tachycardia at ~ 160 bpm.

Features of VT in V1:
* Initial R wave > 30 ms wide, RS interval > 70 ms (Brugada sign) 
* Notching/slurring of the downslope of the S wave in V1/V2 (Josephson sign).

 Features of VT in V6:
* Dominant S wave in V6; qR wave; absence of typical LBBB morphology 
* Abnormal axis with positive aVR, although does not quite meet criteria for northwest axis. 

NB. Note that a positive Brugada sign only requires an RS interval of >60 ms when LBBB morphology is present, compared to >100 ms when RBBB morphology is present.

These features are very different to the expected pattern in LBBB, which has:
* Dominant S wave in V1, but with an R/S interval < 70 ms and minimal initial R wave. 
* Dominant R wave in V6 (often slurred).

Tips for Spotting VT when LBBB morphology present
[NB. LBBB morphology = QRS > 120ms with dominant S wave in V1]

Suspect VT in any patient with a regular broad complex tachycardia (esp if > 160 ms wide).
* Positive QRS complex? 
* Leads I and aVF negative? 
* If yes to both -> northwest axis is present -> probable VT.
* Initial R wave > 30 ms? –> probable VT. 
* Notching of the S wave (Josephson’s sign)? –> probable VT. 
* RS interval > 70 ms (Brugada’s sign)? –> probable VT. 
* None of the above –> possible SVT with LBBB. 
* Dominant S wave (R/S ratio < 1)? -> probable VT. 
* Dominant R wave (R/S ratio > 1)?-> possible SVT with LBBB. 

If still uncertain, scrutinise the ECG for:
* AV dissociation — P waves randomly deforming the QRS complexes and T waves. 
* Fusion and capture beats.
* AV dissociation — P waves randomly deforming the QRS complexes and T waves 
* Fusion and capture beats.

AV dissociation: superimposed P waves at a different rate to the QRS complexes

The first of the narrower complexes is a fusion beat, the next two are capture beats.
