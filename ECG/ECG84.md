**ECG ANSWER 84 - ECG 2**

Key features:
* Rate 60 bpm 
* Regular V-paced rhythm 
* LBBB Morphology 
* Significant progression of ST and T wave changesMassive ST elevation (>5mm) in leads V2-4 also proportionately >25% of QRS depthDiscordant ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5Significantly more pronounced than on previous ECGConcordant ST elevation in leads I and V6 
* Massive ST elevation (>5mm) in leads V2-4 also proportionately >25% of QRS depth 
* Discordant ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5Significantly more pronounced than on previous ECG

**INTERPRETATION and OUTCOME**

Sgarbossa positive ECG’s
* Dynamic and progressive ST segment changes 
* Underlying V-paced rhythm with LBBB morphology 

The patient was discussed with the cardiology team and taken for angiography.
This showed an acute mid LAD occlusion treated with a bare metal stent. Post angiography echo showed moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She was discharged following a 2 day in-patient stay.
