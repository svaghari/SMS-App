#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

* Runs of tachycardia are interspersed with long sinus pauses (up to 6 seconds). 
* The sinus rate is extremely slow, varying from 40 bpm down to around 10 bpm in places. 
* Sinus beats are followed by paroxysms of junctional tachycardia at around 140 bpm. 

**Diagnosis**

* This is a good example of sick sinus syndrome leading to the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome.

* The flurries of junctional tachycardia are a compensatory phenomenon attempting to maintain cardiac output in the face of critically low sinus node rates. 
* The syncope likely occurred due to a long sinus pause with temporary loss of cardiac output. This patient needs a pacemaker!
