#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

This is a very worrying ECG demonstrating massive anterolateral STEMI with “tombstone” morphology:

* Gross ST elevation in V1-6, I and aVL. 
* Early Q wave formation in aVL. 
* Reciprocal ST depression in inferior leads II, III and aVF. 

This ECG pattern is seen in proximal LAD occlusion and indicates a large territory infarction with a poor LV ejection fraction and high likelihood of cardiogenic shock and death.
