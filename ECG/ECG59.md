#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**
* Sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular ectopics in a pattern of ventricular bigeminy.
* Grossly prolonged QT interval (> 600 ms). 
* “R on T” phenomenon is present, with each VEB falling on the end of the T wave — this ECG pattern is very high risk for deterioration to torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation.
* Relatively short PR interval and possible delta waves (leads I, II, V6) are suggestive — but not diagnostic — of WPW syndrome.
* Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy are present in multiple leads.

This patient had suffered a cardiac arrest in the context of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and long QT syndrome.
(NB. ~1/3 of patients with HOCM will have some evidence of WPW on their ECG).

Can you guess what happened next?

The patient had a further TdP cardiac arrest!
This was treated with IV magnesium and potassium, with restoration of sinus rhythm.
This interesting case is discussed in Cardiovascular Curveball 003
