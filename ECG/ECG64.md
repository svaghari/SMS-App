#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

Key Abnormalities
* There is ST elevation in the inferior leads II, III and aVF. 
* The concave morphology might lead you to suspect pericarditis – however, there is reciprocal change in the high lateral leads I and aVL, confirming the diagnosis of inferior STEMI.

There are additional features suggestive of right ventricular infarction:
* ST elevation in III > II 
* Isoelectric ST segment in V1 with ST depression in V2 

Other Abnormalities
* There is a break in the rhythm towards the end of the rhythm strip, with what appears to be a non-conducted P wave, suggesting the development of 2nd degree AV block — e.g. a slowly-evolving Wenckbach cycle. 
* The 13th QRS complex appears to be a supraventricular ectopic beat (PAC or PJC).
