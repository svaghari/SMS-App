#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

NOTE:
* ECG taken at 50 mm/s (usual paper speed is 25 mm/s) <https://litfl.com/ecg-rate-interpretation/>
* V4-6 not on ECG Paper﻿ 

Rate:
* ~310 
* As 50 mm/s Rate = number of big squares between R-R complex divided into 600 (or) 
* As 50 mm/s Rate = number of small squares between R-R complex divided into 3000 

Rhythm:
* Regular 
* Nil P Waves Visible 

Axis:
* RAD (105 deg) 

Intervals:
* PR – Nil p waves visible 
* QRS – Narrow (40ms) 
* QT – 140ms 

Additional/Segment:
* Incomplete precordial Leads Limit Interpretation 

Interpretation:
* Narrow Complex Tachycardia / SVT 

Causes
* ~50% of Paediatric SVTs have no underlying heart disease 
* Can be secondary to fever & drugs 
* ~25% of Paediatric SVTs have congenital heart disease 
* ~25% of Paediatric SVTs have WPW
