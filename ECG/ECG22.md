#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

This ECG displays the characteristic electrocardiographic features of quetiapine toxicity:

* Sinus tachycardia due to anticholinergic effects. 
* Prolonged QT interval (QT interval > half the RR interval; QTc = 560ms).

A similar pattern would be seen with other atypical antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine or clozapine.

Significance of QT prolongation

* QT prolongation is a common source of concern in patients with antipsychotic toxicity, because of the theoretical risk of Torsades de Pointes.
* A QTc interval > 500 ms is commonly cited as a marker of increased risk of TdP. 
* However, tachycardia (which is almost ubiquitous in significant poisoning with quetiapine, olanzapine or clozapine) is actually protective against TdP. 
* For this reason, TDP rarely occurs with quetiapine toxicity.

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

QT interval nomogram
* Many Australian toxicologists use the QT interval nomogram to assess risk of TdP. 
* The absolute QT interval is measured manually in multiple leads and the median QT interval plotted on the nomogram (read how to do this here).
* Plots above the line indicate significant QT prolongation and consequent risk of TdP.

By my measurements, our patient has an absolute QT of ~320 ms with HR 120 so plots below the line — i.e. not at significant risk of TdP.
