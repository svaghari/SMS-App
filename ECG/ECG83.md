**OUTCOME**

This patient had no history of chest pain, nil pre-existing medical condition and was not significantly unwell from her assumed cholecystitis. Vital signs and electrolytes were normal.
She was admitted under the cardiology team for further investigation of ECG abnormalities with surgical consultation for management of cholecystitis.

The patient had raised cardiac biomarkers and underwent angiography.
Angiogram showed no coronary vessel disease but Takotsubo pattern cardiomyopathy, EF 35-40%. The patient was commenced on beta-blocker, ACE and diuretic therapy and underwent elective cholecystectomy once cardiac function and follow-up echo returned to normal.
