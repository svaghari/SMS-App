#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Diagnosis**

This ECG shows a regular broad complex tachycardia with an RSR’ pattern in V1.
The differential diagnosis could include:

* Ventricular tachycardia. 
* SVT with aberrant conduction — either due to RBBB or WPW.

On closer inspection, the ECG demonstrates some classic features of ventricular tachycardia:

* Northwest axis — QRS is positive in aVR, negative in I and aVF. 
* The taller left rabbit ear sign — There is an atypical RBBB pattern in V1, where the left “rabbit ear” is taller than the right. 
* Negative QRS complex (R/S ratio < 1) in V6. 

These findings indicate VT rather than SVT with aberrancy.

* Taller left rabbit ear = VT - <https://litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ECG-VT-Taller-left-rabbit-ear.jpg> 
* Taller right rabbit ear = RBBB - <https://litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/RBBB-typical-morphology-300x123.jpg>

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

Other factors that increase the likelihood of VT in patients presenting with regular broad complex tachycardia include:

* Age > 35 (positive predictive value of 85%). 
* Structural heart disease — e.g. IHD, CCF, cardiomyopathy. 
* Family history of sudden cardiac death or arrhythmogenic conditions such as HOCM, Brugada syndrome or ARVC that are associated with episodes of VT. 

In any patient with a broad complex rhythm, also consider the possibility of toxic / metabolic conditions such as hyperkalaemia or sodium-channel blockade.
