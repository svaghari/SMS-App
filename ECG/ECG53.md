#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

This rhythm is frequently misidentified as atrial fibrillation. However, note in this case:
* Well-defined sawtooth waves in II, III, aVF with regular rate (~300bpm) and consistent morphology. 
* Positive flutter waves (“pseudo-P waves”) in V1-2. 
* The rhythm is not irregularly irregular. There are repeating patterns of identical R-R intervals that crop up throughout the rhythm strip, corresponding to AV conduction ratios of either 2:1 or 4:1. 

This is atrial flutter with a variable block.

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

Misidentifying this rhythm as AF is not normally a big problem as both conditions are managed similarly — i.e. rate control, anticoagulation.

However, flutter will cardiovert with lower energy than AF — e.g. 50 j compared with 100-200 j.
