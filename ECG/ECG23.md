#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

This ECG demonstrates the key features of sotalol toxicity:
* Sinus bradycardia (42 bpm) 
* Very long QT interval (~600 ms). 

Sotalol is a beta blocker with additional class III effects (potassium channel blockade), so it causes both bradycardia and QT prolongation in overdose.

Risk of Torsades
* In comparison to ECG Quiz 022, this patient is at significant risk of TdP. <https://litfl.com/ecg-case-022/>
* The combination of bradycardia and significant QT prolongation means that this patient plots well above the “at risk” line on the QT nomogram. 
* Prophylaxis of TdP in this case would include correction of QT-dependent electrolytes (K, Mg, Ca) to the high-normal range and positive chronotropy (e.g. with isoprenaline) to move the patient below the at-risk line.
