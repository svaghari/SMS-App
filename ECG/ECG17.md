#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

Top rhythm strip
* Regular narrow complex tachycardia. 
* Pseudo-R’ waves (retrograde P waves) are seen deforming the J point.

Middle rhythm strip 
* 12mg adenosine given 
* A salvo of broad and bizarre-looking complexes interrupts the rhythm (this is a common phenomenon during chemical cardioversion with adenosine) 

Bottom rhythm strip
* The patient has reverted to sinus rhythm. 
* The pseudo-R’ waves have now disappeared. 
* There are no obvious delta waves of WPW, but this should be confirmed on a 12-lead ECG.

---------------

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

The 12-lead ECG confirms reversion to sinus rhythm and does not demonstrate any features of WPW. The diagnosis is AV-nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT).
