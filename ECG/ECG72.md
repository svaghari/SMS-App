#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

Initial 3 Complexes
* Rate: ~65-68 
* Rhythm: Regular 
* Axis: Normal 

Intervals:
* PR – Normal (~160ms) 
* QRS – Normal (100ms) 
* QT – 400ms (QTc Bazette ~420-430 ms) 

Segments:
* ST Depression I, II, III 

Additional:
* P Wave Inversion Lead I 

Interpretation:
* Ectopic Atrial Rhythm with ischaemic features 

Subsequent ECG
* Ventricular ectopic with ‘R-onT’ phenomenon 
* Polymorphic VT –> VF 

Interpretation:
* Acute myocardial ischaemia / infarction causing polymorphic VT / VF 

What happened next ?
* CPR 
* Received 4 x 200J shocks 
* 150mg iv amiodarone 
* 100 mg iv lignocaine 

Subsequent ROSC was achieved after < 10 minutes. Post ROSC ECG showed antero-lateral ST elevation.The patient underwent inter-hospital transfer for PCI.PCI revealed a proximal LAD lesion with 90% occlusion, which was stented. Echo showed
* Normal LV size with anterior, septal and apical akinesis and overall moderate systolic impairment 
* Probable LV apical thrombus 
* Normal right ventricular size and apical akinesis and overall mild systolic impairment.

The patient was subsequently discharged on warfarin, anti-platelet therapy, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, and a statin.

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

Things to think about
* The role of early revascularisation with thrombolysis prior to inter-hospital transfer 
* The role of lignocaine/lidocaine in shock refractory VT/VFSeveral International Guidelines on ALS are linked to below and the recommendations on the use of lignocaine vary between guidelines
