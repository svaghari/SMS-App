#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Findings**

* Irregular narrow-complex rhythm (overall rate = 72 bpm). 
* Normal sinus P waves are seen (upright in lead II), indicating a sinus origin of the rhythm. 
* QRS complexes cluster in groups, separated by non-conducted P waves. 
* The PR interval progressively prolongs within each group. 
* The PR prolongation can be appreciated by comparing the first and last PR interval of each group. 

**Diagnosis**

This is the typical appearance of 2nd degree AV block with Mobitz I conduction (Wenckebach phenomenon).

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

Clinical Significance
In comparison to patients with Mobitz II, who typically require a pacemaker for prophylaxis of complete heart block and ventricular standstill, patients with Mobitz I do not necessarily need any intervention.

This is provided that they are asymptomatic with a normal BP, and that reversible causes such as drug toxicity (beta-lockers, digoxin), hyperkalaemia and myocardial ischaemia have been excluded.

The risk of progression to haemodynamically unstable AV block in these patients is very low.
