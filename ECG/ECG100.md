#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

Rate: 60 bpm 

Rhythm:
* Regular 
* Sinus rhythm 

Axis:
* Normal 

Intervals:
* PR – Normal 
* QRS – Normal 

Additional:
* ST Elevation in leads aVR & aVL (<1mm font=””> 
* Upsloping ST depression in leads V2-6 Maximal in leads V3-4 
* Maximal in leads V3-4 
* Flat ST depression in the inferior leads 
* Prominent T waves in leads V2-4  

Interpretation:
* Features consistent with a De Winter patternSuggesting potential LAD pathologyDDx Demand ischaemia / perfusion mismatch <https://litfl.com/de-winter-t-wave-ecg-library/>
* Suggesting potential LAD pathology 
* DDx Demand ischaemia / perfusion mismatch 

Given the patients age and medical history broader differentials for shock and ischaemic ECG features would be:
* PE 
* Sepsis 
* Endocrine – Sheehan Syndrome (postpartum pituitary gland necrosis)

**CLINICAL OUTCOME**

Following review of the initial ECG urgent cardiology input was obtained and an emergent CTPA was performed to exclude PE as a potential cause.
On return from a negative CTPA the patient complained of further chest pain, repeat ECG below:

Clear anterolateral ST elevation and inferior ST depression. The patient was transferred for urgent angiography which showed a 90% mid LAD lesion treated with bioresorbable stent.

Subsequent CTPA revealed a coronary artery dissection as the cause for the acute LAD lesion.

Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)

This is a rare phenomena occurring in ~4% of all acute MI’s. Approximately 90% of cases occur in females and it accounts for 1/4 of MI’s in the under 50 yr old age group. Recurrence rate is between 13-18%.There are multiple risk factors including:
* Fibromuscular dysplasia 
* Pregnancy 
* Connective tissue disorders 
* Systemic inflammatory conditions 
* Intense exercise 
* Intense emotional stress 
* Labour and delivery 
* Valsalva-like events 
* Sympathomimetic use
