#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

This ECG demonstrates the typical features of dextrocardia:
* Marked right axis deviation (+180 degrees).
* Lead aVR: Positive QRS complex (upright P and T waves). 
* Lead I: inversion of all complexes, aka ‘global negativity’ (inverted P-QRS-T). 
* Absent R-wave progression in the chest leads (dominant S waves throughout). 

**Differential Diagnosis**

Accidental reversal of the left and right arm electrodes may produce a similar picture to dextrocardia in the limb leads, but with normal appearances in the precordial leads.
