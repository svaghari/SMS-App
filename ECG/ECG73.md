#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Rate:**
95-100 

**Rhythm:**
* Sinus Rhythm 
* Regular 

Axis:
* Normal (80 deg)

Intervals:
* PR – Short (~80-100ms) 
* QRS – Prolonged (100-120ms) 
* QT – 320ms (QTc Bazett ~ 400 ms) 

Segments:
* Normal

Additional:
* T Inversion V1, aVR 
* Biphasic T wave V2 
* RSR’ Pattern V1 
* ? Slurring QRS – II,III, V4 

Interpretation:
* T wave changes 
* Prominent R waves V5-6 (less than age adjusted upper limit) 
* RSR’ Pattern V1 
* Short pr interval 
* QRS Prolongation – QRS duration > 80ms in children <8yrs is abnormal 
* S wave aVL – ? pseudo-infarction pattern 
* Possible slurring QRS Upstroke

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

Features suggestive of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
* T wave and prominent R waves consistent with age 
* I don’t have any further clinical information of this case as to the final diagnosis 

Paediatric ECGs are challenging with normal intervals and morphology differing from both adult ECGs and by patient age. If in doubt as to the presence of pathology review of the ECG by a paediatric cardiologist is desirable
