#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

* The first half of the ECG shows sinus rhythm with prominent U waves and a long QU interval (520ms).
* An atrial ectopic beat kicks off a run of Torsades de Pointes by landing on the T/U wave during the vulnerable phase of repolarisation and causing “R on T” (or “R on U”) phenomenon.

Diagnosis
The combination of…

* Atrial ectopy 
* Prominent U waves 
* Long QU interval 
* Torsades de Pointes 
… is strongly suggestive of severe hypokalaemia. This patient had a K of 1.9 mmol/L.

Hypokalaemia occurs in eating disorders via multiple mechanisms including:
* Loss of K+ in bodily secretions — vomiting, purging with laxatives or diuretics. 
* Reduced oral intake. 
* Metabolic alkalosis from vomiting causing intracellular shifts of K+. 
* Hypovolaemia causing secondary aldosteronism with renal loss of K+.

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

U wave morphology
The appearance of U waves in hypokalemia may vary. This example demonstrates discrete U waves that are clearly distinguishable from the T wave.
Compare this with Quiz ECG 006, where the whole ST-T-U complex is fused together to produce a “rollercoaster” appearance, with the U wave appearing as a positive deflection that emerges from a negative ST segment and T wave.
