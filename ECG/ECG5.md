#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

This ECG demonstrates an anterolateral STEMI
* ST elevation in V2-6, I and aVL 
* Reciprocal ST depression in III and aVF 
* Pathological Q waves in V2-3 
* Hyperacute T waves in V2-4

This pattern of changes in consistent with acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.

---------------

#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
There is transient improvement in the ST changes, with development of biphasic T waves in V2-3.

This pattern of T wave changes in V2-3 is known as Wellens syndrome and indicates reperfusion of a previously occluded LAD artery.
The implication of this ECG pattern is that there is an underlying critical LAD stenosis that needs urgent intervention with angiography +/ stenting or CABG.

---------------

#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
The previously biphasic T waves are now upright again — this phenomenon is referred to as pseudonormalisation and is a marker of re-occlusion of the culprit artery.
Despite temporary restoration of blood flow in ECG 5b, the patient is now re-infarcting!

---------------

#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
This ECG demonstrates a frank anterolateral STEMI with evolving ST changes.
This patient had a VF arrest shortly after this ECG was taken, was placed on a mechanical CPR device and taken immediately to the cath lab where she was found to have a 100% proximal LAD occlusion. She was stented, successfully cardioverted and made a good neurological recovery.
