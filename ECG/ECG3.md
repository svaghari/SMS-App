#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormal Findings**
* Severe bradycardia of 36 bpm.
* Rhythm is difficult to ascertain — appears irregular (?slow AF) although there are some small-voltage P waves seen in V1-2. 
* Broad QRS complexes with an atypical LBBB morphology.
* Subtle symmetrical peaking (“tenting”) of the T waves in V2-5. 

**Diagnosis**

The combination of bradycardia, flattening and loss of P waves, QRS broadening and T wave abnormalities is highly suspicious for severe hyperkalaemia. This patient had a potassium of 8.0 in the context of anuric renal failure.

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

When you see the combination of…
* Bradycardia 
* Blocks — e.g. AV block, bundle branch blocks 
* Bizarre QRS complexes 
…. think **hyperkalaemia!**
