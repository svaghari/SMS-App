#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

This is a classic ECG of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity, demonstrating multiple characteristic abnormalities.

Signs of sodium-channel blockade
* Broad QRS complexes (120 ms, or 3 small squares). 
* Positive R’ wave in lead aVR > 3 mm. 
* Prolonged PR interval (240 ms). 
* Long QT interval (> 1/2 the RR interval). 
* Brugada-like pattern in V1.

Signs of anticholinergic toxidrome
* Sinus tachycardia (~ 110 bpm), with P waves embedded in each T wave.

This patient had taken a life-threatening overdose of dosulepin (a Tricyclic antidepressant TCA).

**How to Spot Sodium-Channel Blockade**
* QRS prolongation (> 100ms or 2.5 small squares), typically measured in lead II. 
* A terminal or secondary R wave (R’ wave) in aVR > 3 mm. 
* An R’/S ratio in aVR > 0.7. 

**Prognostic Value of the ECG**

In patients with TCA overdose, the degree of QRS prolongation correlates with the degree of clinical toxicity:
* QRS width > 100 ms is predictive of seizures. 
* QRS width > 160 ms is predictive of cardiotoxicity (e.g. broad-complex dysrhythmias, hypotension).

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

The combination of PR prolongation and sinus tachycardia with TCA overdose often makes the P waves difficult to see, and may lead the rhythm to be incorrectly identified as VT. This patient needs bicarbonate and hyperventilation, not electricity and amiodarone!

The clinical significance of a TCA-induced Brugada ECG pattern remains controversial — i.e. is it purely a manifestation of severe sodium-channel blockade, or does it represent “unmasking” of underlying Brugada syndrome? These issues are discussed here.
