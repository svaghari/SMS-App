#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**
* The ECG shows widespread ST segment abnormalities. 
* There is a biphasic appearance to the ST segments and T waves, with initial negative deflection (= ST segment depression / T wave inversion) followed by a terminal positive deflection (= U wave). 
* All these waves merge into each other and it is difficult to tell where one wave ends and the other begins. 
* There is gross prolongation of the QU interval (= time from onset of QRS complex to end of T/U wave). 

**Diagnosis**

The combination of…
* Widespread ST depression / T wave inversion 
* Prominent U waves 
* Long QU interval (> 500 ms) 
…. is highly suggestive of severe hypokalaemia.
This patient had a serum K of 1.7 mmol/L in the context of decompensated Conn’s syndrome (primary aldosteronism).

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

Biphasic T waves may be seen with both myocardial ischaemia (Wellens syndrome) and hypokalaemia.
The main differentiating factor (apart from the clinical picture) is the direction of the T waves:
* Wellens: – biphasic T waves go UP then DOWN. 
* Hypokalaemia: – T waves go DOWN then UP.
