#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

Rate: ~115 bpm 

Rhythm:
* Regular 
* Sinus Rhythm 

Axis:
* Normal 

Intervals:
* PR – Normal (~160ms) 
* QRS – Normal (100ms) 
* QT – 320ms 

Segments:
* ST elevation leads aVR (<1mm), V1 (1mm), V2 (2mm) 
* ST depression lead I 

Additional:
* Biphasic T wave leads aVF & V3 
* T wave inversion leads I, II, aVL and deep inversion leads V4-6 
* Voltage criteria for LVHS V2 (25mm) + R V6 (20mm) 
* S V2 (25mm) + R V6 (20mm) 
* R wave peak time in leads V5 & V6 ~60ms 
* P waves wide with deep terminal deflection in lead V1 with notching in lead II 

Interpretation:
* Sinus tachycardia 
* ECG features for:LVHLAE 
* LVH 
* LAE 
* Deep anterolateral T wave inversion 

**Broad differentials**

These ECG features could be seen in a wide range of conditions and include:
* Ischaemia 
* Myocarditis 
* Acid-base / electrolyte disturbance 
* Raised ICP

**OUTCOME**

The key to interpretation of any ECG, or any test for that matter, is looking at the test and then taking it back to the patient in question.

In this case we have a young male with no acute cardiac complaint, i.e. nil chest pain, dyspnea, and a known cardiac condition. Given these factors the most likely cause is apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AHCM) given the absence of Q waves and deep T wave inversion in the precordial leads, this patient did in fact have known apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
