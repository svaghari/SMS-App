#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

This is the same patient from ECG 014
Posterior leads confirm the presence of posterior wall infarction by demonstrating typical STEMI morphology:

* ST elevation in V7-9 
* Q waves in V7-9 
* Inversion of the terminal portion of the T wave (“U wave inversion“) in V7-9

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

How To Record Posterior Leads

Simply move the V4-6 electrodes around to the back in the same horizontal plane as V6. Annotate the ECG accordingly.
Approximate positions for V7-9 are:

* V7 – left posterior axillary line 
* V8 – tip of left scapula 
* V9 – left paraspinal region
