#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

Rate: ~42 

Rhythm:
* Regularly irregular Complexes occurring in paired group 
* Complexes occurring in paired group 
* Flat baseline without atrial activity 

Axis:
* 1st Complex in pairNormal (70 deg) 
* Normal (70 deg) 
* 2nd Complex in pairLAD(-45 deg) 
* LAD(-45 deg) 

Intervals:
* 1st Complex in pairQRS – Normal (80ms)QT – 520ms 
* QRS – Normal (80ms) 
* QT – 520ms 
* 2nd Complex in pairQRS – Normal in limb leads, Prolonged V1-3 (80-120ms)QT – 440ms 
* QRS – Normal in limb leads, Prolonged V1-3 (80-120ms) 
* QT – 440ms 

Segments:
* 1st Complex in pairST Depression leads II, aVF 
* ST Depression leads II, aVF 
* 2nd Complex in pairMinimal ST elevation lead aVR 
* Minimal ST elevation lead aVR 

Additional:
* 1st Complex in pairT wave inversion II, III, aVFBiphasic T lead V3 
* T wave inversion II, III, aVF 
* Biphasic T lead V3 
* 2nd Complex in pairRsR’ Morphology V1-3Inverted notching terminal portion QRS II, III, aVF also positive notching aVL?

Retrograde P waves ? Secondary to conduction delay 
* RsR’ Morphology V1-3 
* Inverted notching terminal portion QRS II, III, aVF also positive notching aVL? Retrograde P waves ? Secondary to conduction delay 
* ? Retrograde P waves ? Secondary to conduction delay 

Interpretation:
* Escape bigeminyIn setting of sinus arrest / sinus exit block 
* In setting of sinus arrest / sinus exit block 
* Non-specific ST / T wave changes 

Differential of causes:
* Ischaemia 
* Electrolyte disturbance 
* Acid-base disturbance 
* Cardiotoxic drugs 
* Sinus node dysfunction 
* HypothermiaMultifactorial combination of above 
* Multifactorial combination of above

**WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?**

Bloods showed:
* Acute on chronic renal failure 
* Metabolic acidosis – pH 7.0 Bicarb 7.0 
* K 6.0 

Treated with isoprenaline, sodium bicarb, cessation of cardiotoxic medication, and dialysis.

Following acute episode found to have sinus pauses on telemetry necessitating pacemaker insertion.
