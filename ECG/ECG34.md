#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

The ECG changes are partially masked by the presence of a right bundle branch block, but there is clear evidence of anteroseptal STEMI:
* Gross ST elevation in V1-3 (~ 5mm in V2). 
* Convex ST elevation in I and aVL. 
* Reciprocal ST depression and T wave inversion in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF).

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

Predicting the Site of LAD Occlusion

This ECG demonstrates some markers of a very proximal LAD occlusion, involving the two most proximal branches of the LAD — the first septal branch (S1) and the first diagonal branch (D1).

Signs of basal septal involvement:
* New RBBB — occurs due to septal infarction 
* ST elevation in V1 > 2.5 mm 
* ST elevation in aVR
* ST depression in V5 

Signs of high lateral involvement:
* ST elevation in aVL 
* Inferior reciprocal ST depression > 1 mm  

This patient arrived by ambulance following an out-of-hospital VF arrest and was taken straight to the cath lab where he was found to have a complete ostial occlusion of his LAD.

**A Common Pitfall** 

This STEMI pattern is occasionally missed, when clinicians erroneously attribute the ST segment changes in V1-3 to RBBB alone.
However, the two patterns are quite different:
* Typical RBBB will have ST depression and TWI in V1-3. 
* Superimposed septal STEMI will lead to ST elevation, Q wave formation, loss of the initial R wave and inversion of only the terminal portion of the T wave.
