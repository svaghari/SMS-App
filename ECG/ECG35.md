#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

On first glance this ECG could easily be mistaken for an example of Mobitz II AV block — there are intermittent non-conducted P waves with a constant PR interval. However, regular pacing spikes can be seen following the P waves in leads V3-6.

This is an example of pacemaker malfunction, with intermittent failure to capture:

* Regular P waves are seen at ~65 bpm. 
* Each P wave is following by a pacing spike (best seen in V3-6, subtle pacing spikes also present in I, aVR, V1). This indicates that atrial sensing is intact. NB. Pacing spikes will typically not be seen in all 12 leads.  
* Some of the pacing spikes are followed by typical ventricular-paced complexes. The LBBB morphology indicates that the pacing lead is in the right ventricle — the heart depolarises from right to left in the same way as LBBB. Also note the negative concordance in V1-6 (all QRS complexes are negative). This is often quoted as a feature of ventricular tachycardia, but simply indicates that the rhythm is arising from the anterior surface of the right ventricle — the heart is depolarising away from the V1-6 electrodes.
* Several of the P waves / pacing spikes are not followed by QRS complexes, producing a ventricular rate of ~ 40 bpm. 
* Quite worryingly, there does not seem to be any native ventricular activity kicking in when the heart rate drops. The second half of the rhythm strip shows two sequential non-conducted P waves with no evidence of any escape rhythm. This suggests the presence of underlying complete heart block with inadequate escape mechanisms and significant risk of ventricular standstill.

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

Failure to Capture

The problem here is failure of the pacemaker to “capture” (depolarise) the ventricular myocardium. Causes of this include:
* Pacemaker lead fracture or migration (e.g. due to Twiddler’s syndrome). <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200304243481722>
* Refractory myocardium — due to electrolyte abnormality (esp. hyperkalaemia) or myocardial ischaemia. <https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/>
