#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

This ECG is diagnostic of the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome:
* Sinus rhythm with a very short PR interval (< 120ms).
* Broad QRS complexes. 
* Delta waves = slurred upstroke to the QRS.

**Other Features:**
* Dominant S wave in V1 — this “type B” pattern indicates a right-sided accessory pathway. 
* Tall R waves and inverted T waves mimic the appearance of LVH — this is an electrical phenomenon due to WPW and not a sign of ventricular hypertrophy.
* ST segments and T waves show typical “discordant” changes — they point in in the opposite direction to the QRS complex, similar to LBBB.
