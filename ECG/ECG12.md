#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**
* Giant T-wave inversions in multiple leads, most prominent in V2-6 
* Marked QT prolongation > 600 ms 

**Diagnosis**

ECG pattern is characteristic of raised intracranial pressure and is classically seen in the context of massive intracranial haemorrhage, particularly:

* Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage 
* Haemorrhagic stroke 

Similar ECG patterns have also been reported in patients with raised ICP due to:

* Large-territory ischaemic stroke causing cerebral oedema (e.g. MCA occlusion) 
* Traumatic brain injury 

The differential diagnosis for widespread T-wave inversions and QT prolongation includes myocardial ischaemia (e.g. Wellens syndrome) and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypokalemia). However, neither condition would cause the gigantic “cerebral T waves” seen here.
