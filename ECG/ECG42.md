#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

This is a typical example of atrial flutter with 2:1 AV block
* Narrow complex tachycardia at 150 bpm. 
* Sawtooth flutter waves are seen in the inferior leads II, III, aVF. 
* Upright flutter waves in V1 appear either as pseudo-P waves or as notches in the T wave. 
* There is a clear 2:1 relationship between the flutter waves (300 bpm) and QRS complexes (150 bpm).

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

Tips for Spotting Atrial Flutter
* Suspect flutter with 2:1 block in any patient with a regular NCT at 150 bpm. 
* Scrutinise leads II and V1 for flutter waves. 
* Flutter waves are typically sawtooth in lead II and resemble P waves in V1. 
* Try turning the ECG upside down — this can make the flutter waves in lead II easier to see. 

Inverting the ECG makes flutter waves in lead II easier to see
