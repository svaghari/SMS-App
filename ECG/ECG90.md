#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

Rate:
* Ventricular rate 42 bpm 
* Atrial rate 84 bpm 

Rhythm:
* Irregular atrial activity 
* Short P-P (Green) followed by long P-P (Red) – see image below

* The shorter P-P interval occurs when a ventricular (QRS) complex occurs between the P waves whilst the longer P-P interval occurs when there is no ventricular (QRS) complex between the P waves 
* This phenomenon is known as Ventriculophasic Arrhythmia 
* 2:1 AV Block with ventricular (QRS) complexes only occurring after every second P wave 

Axis:
* LAD 

Intervals:
* QRS – Prolonged (160ms) 

Segments:
* Subtle ST elevation leads II, III, aVL 

Additional:
* RBBB Morphology 

Interpretation:
* 2:1 2nd Degree AV Block 
* Bifascicular blockRBBB + LAFB 
* RBBB + LAFB 
* Ventriculophasic Sinus Arrhythmia 
* Symptomatic Patient with syncope

**OUTCOME**

The patient was referred to the cardiology team and had an uneventful PPM insertion.

Ventriculophasic Sinus Arrhythmia
This ECG is a nice example of ventriculophasic arrhythmia, this phenomenon can be seen in up 40% of case of complete AV block and, as in this case, can be seen with 2nd degree AV block also.You get a shorter P-P interval when there is an associate QRS complex with a longer P-P when there is no QRS between the P waves. Several mechanisms have been proposed including  alterations in sinus node perfusion related to ventricular contraction and the mechanical effects of atrial stretch.

To make things more confusing there is a much rarer paradoxical phenomenon when the P-P is longer when a QRS is contained between them.

It is important to recognized as the P-P variability may be mistaken for other ECG features such as U waves for example.
