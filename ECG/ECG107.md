#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
Rate: Mean ventricular rate ~24 bpm 

Rhythm:
* Irregular ventricular rhythm 
* No visible P waves 
* Irregular pacing spikes mean rate of 43 bpm 
* No evidence of capture 

Axis: 
* Normal 

Intervals: 
* QRS â€“ Prolonged 

Additional:
* ST depression with T wave inversion leads II, III, aVF 

Interpretation:
* Pacemaker failure to capture 
* Underlying marked slow atrial fibrillation

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

**CLINICAL OUTCOME**

What happened next?

The patient had moderate renal failure with a normal potassium.
CXR showed no lead abnormality and lead placement appeared unaltered.
His metoprolol was ceased and the pacemaker threshold was reprogrammed with resultant 100% capture.
