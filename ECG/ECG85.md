**ECG ANSWER 85 - ECG 1**

Rate: 72 bpm 

Rhythm:
* Sinus rhythm 
* Single PAC (Complex #7) 

Axis:
* Normal  

Intervals:
* PR – Normal (160ms) 
* QRS – Normal (100ms) 
* QT – 360ms 

Segments:
* ST Depression leads I, V4-6 

Interpretation:
* Lateral ST segment depressionGiven associated Hx of chest pain ischaemia is the main concern

**ECG ANSWER 85 - ECG 2**

Rate: 72 bpm 

Rhythm:
* Regular 
* Sinus rhythm 

Axis:
* Normal  

Intervals:
* PR – Normal (180-200ms) 
* QRS – Normal (80ms) 
* QT – 360ms 

Segments:
* ST Depression leads I, II, aVL, V2-6 
* ST Elevation lead aVR (~1mm) 

Additional:
* Markedly prominent T waves leads I, V2-6 

Interpretation:
* De Winter T Wave PatternSuggests acute LAD lesion requiring emergent reperfusion  
* Suggests acute LAD lesion requiring emergent reperfusion  
* Dynamic ECG changes compared with previous ECG 

---------------

**OUTCOME**

The ECG changes were recognised by the treating team. The patient was taken for emergency PCI which showed:
* LAD – 100% Occlusion – 2 x stents inserted 
* RAC – 30% proximal stenosis 

Post stent echocardiogram showed:
* Mild systolic dysfunction 
* Akinesis of anterior septum and apical region 
* LVEF ~40-45% 

The patient was discharged after a 4 day in-patient stay.

I think there are two key learning points from this case:
* The need for serial ECG’s 
* Recognition of De Winter’s T Wave Pattern
