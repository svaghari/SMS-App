#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
Rate: 96 bpm 

Rhythm:
* Regular 
* Sinus rhythm 

Axis:
* Normal 

Intervals:
* PR – Normal (~180ms) 
* QRS – Normal (80ms) 
* QT – 500-520ms (QTc Bazett 630-660 ms) Measured in lead II 

Additional:
* ST depression in leads II, III, aVF, V4-6 
* Prominent U waves in leads V3-5 
* Occur just before the p wave 
* T-U fusion in all other leads 

Interpretation:
* Marked QT ProlongationFeatures supportive of hypokalaemia / hypomagnesaemiaU waves T-U fusionVariable QT measurement lead II vs lead V3 (end of T wave more easily identifiable) 
* Features supportive of hypokalaemia / hypomagnesaemia 
* U waves T-U fusion 
* Variable QT measurement lead II vs lead V3 (end of T wave more easily identifiable) 
* Potential contribution from sotalol – known QTc prolonging agent <https://litfl.com/sotalol/>

**CLINICAL OUTCOME**

Shortly after this ECG was performed the patient became unresponsive with the following ECG rhythm strip.
<https://litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ECG-Case-101b-LITFL-Top-100-EKG-1024x288.jpeg> 

The rhythm strip shows sinus rhythm with several PVC’s with resultant R-on-T phenomenon and degeneration into polymorphic VT. This episode of brief and self-terminated.

Bloods revealed several metabolic alkalosis, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia.

The patient was admitted to a critical care area for monitoring and correction of electrolyte / acid-base disturbance. In addition her sotalol was ceased due to its associated risk of QTc prolongation and she was commenced on metoprolol.
