#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

This is a fascinating ECG with multiple abnormalities:

* The first half of the tracing shows a ventricular paced rhythm with positive Sgarbossa criteria indicating superimposed inferior STEMI.
* There is excessively discordant ST elevation (> 25% of Q/S wave depth) in II, III and aVF with reciprocal change in I and aVL.
* A ventricular ectopic (beat #8) occurs at a vulnerable time, resulting in a run of ventricular flutter (very rapid VT at rates > 200-300 bpm).
* This rapidly degenerates to ventricular fibrillation (seen in the rhythm strip, which is recorded after the other 12 leads). 
* The artefact at the start of the rhythm strip may represent a precordial thump!

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

While most rhythm strips are recorded simultaneously with the 12-lead ECG, some older machines may record the rhythm strip after the other 12 leads.

Consider this as a possibility if your rhythm strip doesn’t seem to “line up” with the rest of the ECG.
