#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**Main Abnormalities**

* ST depression in V2-6, which slopes upwards and joins the ascending limb of the T wave. 
* Prominent, “rocket-shaped” T waves in the precordial leads V2-5. 
* Subtle ST elevation in aVR. 

**Diagnosis**
* This combination of ST depression with rocket-shaped T waves in the precordial leads V1-6 is referred to as the De Winter ECG pattern or “De Winter’s T waves” (also see ECG 019)
* It is becoming increasingly recognised as an anterior STEMI equivalent (~2% of LAD occlusions). 
* Some authors are now recommending that this ECG pattern be treated identically to anterior STEMI, with urgent PCI or thrombolysis. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24176590>
