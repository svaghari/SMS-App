#### ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION

**ECG 1**

Rate: 84 

Rhythm:
* Regular 
* Sinus Rhythm 

Axis:
* Normal (70 deg) 

 Intervals:
* PR – Normal (~160-200ms) 
* QRS – Normal (80ms) 
* QT – 340ms (QTc Bazett ~ 390 ms) 

Segments:
* Slight Saddling ST segments leads II, III, aVF 

**ECG 2**

Rate: 66 

Rhythm:
* Regular 
* Sinus Rhythm 

Axis:
* Normal (-15 deg) 

Intervals:
* PR – Normal (~180 ms) 
* QRS – Normal (80ms) 
* QT – 360ms (QTc Bazett ~ 360 ms) 

Segments:
* Slight Saddling ST segments leads I, aVL 

Additional:
* T Wave Inversion Leads III, aVF 

Initial interpretation:
* This ECG was interpreted as having dynamic ST change ? ACS. 
* The patient was anticoagulated and transferred by air, ~2500 km, to a tertiary centre for further management.

**CLINICAL PEARLS**

…but let’s look again:
* The answer is somewhat less pathological. 
* There is an axis change between the 2 ECGs which is a little odd 
* Look at the complexes in leads III and you can see not only has the T wave become inverted but so has the P wave and QRS complex

* Compare leads aVL & aVF between the two ECGs and we can see these leads have been swapped

The ECG changes are due to a LA / LL lead reversal
* Leads aVL & aVF swap places 
* Leads I & II swap places 
* Lead III becomes completely inverted 
* Lead aVR remains unchanged 
* No change in the precordial leads
